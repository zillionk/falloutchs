#{100}{}{You see Loxley, leader of the Thieves' Guild.}
{100}{}{你看到洛克斯尼，一个盗贼头目。}
#{101}{LOX_0}{It's a little gift from me Da and Mum.  Actually, a few generations before that.  Do you like it?}
{101}{LOX_0}{这是我爹娘留给我的小礼物。其实是更上一代人留下的。你喜欢么？}
#{102}{}{It suits you.}
{102}{}{很适合你。}
#{103}{}{No, it hurts my ears.}
{103}{}{不，它很刺耳。}
#{104}{LOX_0A}{Why, thank you.  Have to work a bit to keep it with so little refinement about, don't you know.  But enough of that. Loxley's the name.  And yours is?}
{104}{LOX_0A}{哎呀，谢谢你。让它保持这种细微的差别还真得费点力气，明白么？不说这个了。我叫洛克斯尼。你是？}
#{105}{}{I'm }
{105}{}{我是}
#{106}{}{.}
{106}{}{。}
#{107}{}{What's it to you?}
{107}{}{对你来说这是什么？}
#{108}{}{What is this place?}
{108}{}{这是什么地方？}
#{110}{LOX_1F}{Bloody impressive making it through the defenses like that!  What's your name, luv?}
{110}{LOX_1F}{像那样穿过外边的防御系统真他妈的让人印象深刻！宝贝儿，你叫什么？}
#{109}{LOX_1M}{Bloody fine job making it through the defenses, mate!  I'm rather impressed.  Toss me your name!}
{109}{LOX_1M}{真他妈漂亮的穿过了外边的防御系统，兄弟！真叫我印象深刻。报个名儿吧！}
#{111}{}{I'm }
{111}{}{我是}
#{112}{}{.}
{112}{}{。}
#{113}{}{What's it to you?}

#{114}{}{What is this place?}
{114}{}{这是什么地方？}

# TRANSLATION NOTE: The following line is the player addressing Loxley (who is male).
#{115}{}{You got a real interesting accent, my friend.}
{115}{}{朋友，你的口音可真有特点。}

#{116}{}{You talk like an idiot.}
{116}{}{你讲话像个白痴。}
#{117}{}{Nuhhh?}
{117}{}{啊哈？}
#{118}{LOX_2F}{Quite pleased to make your acquaintance actually...for now.  Let's get the other bit of politeness taken care of, shall we?  What the bloody, bloody, bloody hell are you doing here!}
{118}{LOX_2F}{很高兴认识你，起码．．．目前为止是。让我们换另外一个客套话题如何？我日，日，日啊，你他妈的来这干吗！}
#{119}{}{I want to join the Circle.}
{119}{}{我想加入工会。}
#{120}{}{I need to ask you a few things.}
{120}{}{我得问你点事儿。}
#{121}{}{I'm taking you all off to jail.}
{121}{}{我要把你们绳之以法。}
#{122}{LOX_3}{Oh, how nice.  A joiner.  Well, you've worked hard enough for a look-see.  But if you really want to join, then you'll have to take the Second Test.}
{122}{LOX_3}{喔，好极了。一个入伙的。呃，你初步考验完成的不错。但是如果你真的想加入，你还得再完成复试。}
#{123}{}{What's that?}
{123}{}{什么复试？}
#{124}{}{Sounds scary . . . How about I pass?}
{124}{}{听起来很难．．．如果我通过了会怎样？}
#{125}{}{Uh . . . what was the first test?}
{125}{}{那个．．．第一个测试是什么来得？}
#{126}{LOX_4}{Quite simple, really.  You prove yourself as a thief.  Succeed, and the world is yours!  If not, then you'll never see us again.  Except if you come looking.  And if you don't understand, that last bit is a threat.}
{126}{LOX_4}{很简单，真的。你证明自己是个盗贼。成功后，你将成为行会的一员！否则，你将永远不会见到我们了。除非你不明白最后一句是个警告而再次回来！}
#{127}{}{What's the test?}
{127}{}{测试内容是什么？}
#{128}{}{Do you mean you'll move this whole place if I fail, or try to kill me.}
{128}{}{你的意思是如果我搞砸了你就会搬家，或者说准备宰了我。}
#{129}{}{Are you threatening me?}
{129}{}{你在威胁我么？}
#{130}{LOX_5}{It's so, so simple.  In the Heights you'll find Daren Hightower's home all plump and ripe for the picking.  Are you ready for life!  Do you accept the challenge?}
{130}{LOX_5}{它非常，非常的简单。在富人区，你可以找到满是值钱的东西可以拿的达伦・海托的家。做好冒险的准备了么？接受这个挑战么？}
#{131}{}{I'm ready!}
{131}{}{我准备好了。}
#{132}{}{Hell, no!}
{132}{}{去他妈的，我不去！}
#{134}{LOX_6F}{That's the spirit, luv!}
{134}{LOX_6F}{干劲不错，甜心！}
#{133}{LOX_6M}{That's the spirit, mate!}
{133}{LOX_6M}{干劲不错，兄弟！}
#{135}{LOX_6B}{Just talk to Jasmine in the room outside this chamber.  She'll give you details, a map, and a few little goodies to help you on your way.  But remember, if you even think about ratting us out to the cops, we'll be a memory before they arrive.  But enough gloom.  Cheerio, good luck, and ta-ta!}
{135}{LOX_6B}{去问外屋的茉莉就行了。她会告诉你细节，给你一张地图和一些帮你完成任务的工具。不过记着，如果你妄图把我们出卖给条子，在他们到达以前，我们就会变成你遗憾的回忆。加油干，祝你好运，回头见！}
#{136}{LOX_7}{Well, then why the bloody hell are you here?  Sightseeing?  The ambiance?  My handsome face?}
{136}{LOX_7}{呃，那你他妈的在这搞毛？参观旅游？气氛温馨？我长得帅？}
#{137}{}{No, I came to ask you a few questions.}
{137}{}{不，我来问你几个问题。}
#{138}{}{Certainly not the face.}
{138}{}{不确定，不过肯定不是因为你长得帅。}
#{139}{}{You're right, I'd like to join the Circle.}
{139}{}{你说对了，我想加入工会。}
#{140}{LOX_8}{That's it?  A few questions!  Well, you're either incredibly brave or a total moron.  Ask away, ask away!...and then we'll show you to the door, shall we?}
{140}{LOX_8}{就为了这？几个问题！好吧，你要么是吃了豹子胆要么就是个纯粹的傻隆Ｎ拾桑问吧！……问完了我们欢送你出门，如何？}
#{141}{LOX_9}{You must be joking!  You think I'd fall for a line like that!  Get out, you commoner!}
{141}{LOX_9}{别扯蛋了！你认为我会欣赏那种话么！滚出去，你个土豹子！}
#{142}{LOX_10}{Oh, quite the little attitude!  But, we're all friends here, aren't we?}
{142}{LOX_10}{啊，很有个性！不过，我们现在都是朋友，不是么？}
#{143}{}{I don't see why.}
{143}{}{我没发现。}
#{144}{}{Your're right. I'm sorry.}
{144}{}{你是对的。不好意思。}
#{145}{LOX_11}{Ohhh, broken heart.  Our chance for camaraderie lost. [Sigh] Jasmine, show this little sod the door.}
{145}{LOX_11}{哦，让人伤心。我们建立友情的机会没了。［叹气］茉莉，送这个老土出去。}
#{146}{LOX_12}{Ooh, a little back and forth.  I like someone who plays the edge.  I think you'll be a great addition to our merry little band.  What say you?}
{146}{LOX_12}{呵，有点曲折，我喜欢兜圈子的人。我认为你会让我们欢乐的小家庭如虎添翼，你说呢？}
#{147}{}{Okay!}
{147}{}{当然！}
#{148}{}{I say you're a total lunatic.}
{148}{}{我想你脑子进水了。}
#{149}{lox_12b}{Okay!}
{149}{lox_12b}{好！}
#{150}{LOX_13}{Oh, bosh and bother.  Well, quite sorry to hear that, actually.  You would've made a fine thief.  But the Circle's not for the terminally stupid.  So, Jasmine, show our guest the door, please.}
{150}{LOX_13}{哦，鬼话连篇。唉，实际上那些话让人很遗憾。你本来可以成为一个优秀的盗贼的，但我们工会不是为彻头彻尾的白痴准备的。所以，茉莉，送客。}
#{151}{LOX_14}{Oh, what do you take me for?  If you want cold blooded murder, talk to Decker and his lot.  If you fail, which seems much more likely at this point, we will simple disappear.  Now, then care to try or not?}
{151}{LOX_14}{哦，你把我当成什么了？如果你要找冷血杀手，去和德克跟他的手下谈谈。如果你搞砸了，从这个角度来说我们更可能会直接闪人。好了，你到底要不要接受复试？}
#{152}{}{Sure.}
{152}{}{当然。}
#{153}{}{Not.}
{153}{}{算了。}
#{154}{LOX_16}{Oh, no.  I'm so afraid.  Life is so hard. Loxley, I'd rather be a coward for all of my life than to have a single moment of triumph.  Ah, just another wanker, aren't you.  Out!}
{154}{LOX_16}{啊，不。我很怕。活着不容易啊，洛克斯尼，我宁愿做一辈子胆小鬼也不愿意出一时的风头。哈，你不就是这种废物么？滚蛋！}
#{155}{LOX_17}{Haven't figured it out yet, have we?  The First Test was just getting here!  That's the only reason I'm considering you.}
{155}{LOX_17}{还没决定，不是么？初试就是到达这里！这是我可以考虑你入会的唯一原因。}
#{156}{}{Okay, I'll do whatever you want!!}
{156}{}{没问题，你让我干啥我就干啥！}
#{157}{}{What's the next test?}
{157}{}{下个测试是什么？}
#{158}{}{Well, all I need to do is ask you a few questions.}
{158}{}{唔，我唯一要做的就是问你几个问题。}
#{159}{LOX_18}{Ha ha ha.  Ooh, that's quite amusing.  Take us to jail, will you?  And how, may I ask, do you plan this feat?}
{159}{LOX_18}{哈哈。哇，太叫人吃惊了。送我们进监狱，当真？那么，凭什么，我可以问下，你计划过这个伟大壮举么？}
#{160}{}{Just come along quietly and no one will get hurt.}
{160}{}{老老实实的就没人会受伤。}
#{161}{}{Well, maybe I'll let you off this time.}
{161}{}{好，或许这次我可以放你一马。}
#{162}{LOX_21}{What's it to me?  It's simple, really.  Tell me your name, or we show you the door.}
{162}{LOX_21}{对于我？这很简单，真的。把你的名字给我，否则我们送你出门。}
#{163}{}{Okay. I'm }
{163}{}{好。我是}
#{164}{}{.}
{164}{}{。}
#{165}{}{How about I show you my boot?}
{165}{}{把我的鞋给你如何？}
#{166}{LOX_22}{This is the famous Thieves' Circle!  I thought you would've known this, seeing's how you made it through all the defenses and whatnot.  But no matter.  You're quite promising, and the Circle could use someone like you.}
{166}{LOX_22}{这儿是著名的盗贼工会！看你穿过防御系统的身手，我还以为你知道的。不过没关系，你很有发展前途，工会需要你这样的人。}
#{167}{}{Okay, what do I have to do?}
{167}{}{好，我需要做什么？}
#{168}{}{No thanks. I would like to ask you some questions, though.}
{168}{}{不了，谢谢。不过我还是想问你几个问题。}
#{169}{}{Not a chance.}
{169}{}{不是个机会。}
#{170}{LOX_23}{Well, you made it through my defenses so you certainly have skills.  What's your name?}
{170}{LOX_23}{嗯，你通过了我的防御系统，那么你一定身手不凡。你叫什么？}
#{171}{}{I'm }
{171}{}{我是}
#{172}{}{.}
{172}{}{。}
#{173}{}{What's it to you?}
{173}{}{对你来说这儿是什么？}
#{174}{}{What is this place?}
{174}{}{这是哪？}

{177}{LOX_24}{你他妈的想怎样？}
#{178}{}{What did I do? Why so hostile?}

#{180}{}{Hey, I'm on your side. I'm here as a friend.}
{180}{}{嘿，我和你站在同一立场。我是以朋友的身份至此。}

#{181}{LOX_25}{I don't like you. Don't know why, don't care.}
{181}{LOX_25}{我不喜欢你。不知道为什么，管它呢。}
#{182}{}{Give me a chance!}
{182}{}{给我个机会吧！}
#{183}{}{Well, you're just an idiot then, aren't you?}
{183}{}{呃，你不过是个蠢蛋而已，不是么？}
#{184}{LOX_26}{Thanks for such a lovely moment.  Jasmine, show our guest out.}
{184}{LOX_26}{谢谢你带给我的短暂愉悦时光。茉莉，送客。}
#{185}{LOX_27}{Oh, how nice to see you again.  Do you have a little something for me?}
{185}{LOX_27}{啊，再次见到你真高兴。你给我带来什么东西了么？}
#{186}{}{My resignation. I decided not to take your stupid test.}
{186}{}{我的辞职书。我不打算完成你的愚蠢测试了。}
#{187}{}{I didn't get it yet.}
{187}{}{我还没弄到手。}
#{188}{}{Here's the necklace . . .}
{188}{}{给你项链．．．}
#{189}{LOX_29}{Ha!  Ha!  Well, done!  Congratulations.  You're now a member of the world famous Thieves' Circle.  Let's get Jasmine over here, and throw a topper, shall we?}
{189}{LOX_29}{哈！哈！干得好！恭喜。你现在已经成为世界著名的盗贼工会的一员了。让我们把茉莉叫来，一起庆祝一番，如何？}
#{190}{LOX_30}{Oh, how funny.  I really must tell you, though, that I don't care much for this kind of a joke.  Kind of a chuckle.  Kind of a put-one-over-on-the-old-Loxley thing huh.  Tell you what.  One more chance.  Bring the necklace here.}
{190}{LOX_30}{啊，真有趣啊。我真的必须无奈的告诉你，虽然我不介意这种玩笑。这种白痴玩笑。这种侮辱我老洛克斯尼的玩笑。告诉你说，最后一次机会。把项链带回来。}
#{191}{LOX_31}{You're really just a complete pain in the ass, aren't you?}
{191}{LOX_31}{你果真他妈的就是个废物，不是么？}
#{192}{LOX_32}{Stupid!  Oh.  I'm so disappointed you feel this way.  Ah, well, our little Circle will just have to carry on without your scintillating presence.  So sad.  Jasmine, the door for our guest.  And no return privileges, hmm?}
{192}{LOX_32}{愚蠢！唉。你如此抉择让我很失望。啊，好吧，我们的盗贼工会会在缺少你这员干将的情况下继续运作。茉莉，送客。也别再回来了，明白么？}
#{193}{LOX_33}{Then what the bloody, bloody hell are you doing here?  Shoo!  Go away.  Only this time come back with the necklace.}
{193}{LOX_33}{我日，日，日啊，你他妈的回来干吗？去！滚回去。不拿到项链就别回来。}
#{194}{}{Anything interesting go on around here?}
{194}{}{这有什么有趣的事情发生么？}
#{195}{}{Tell me about the Hub.}
{195}{}{跟我讲讲哈勃的事。}
#{196}{}{Heard any good rumors lately?}
{196}{}{最近听到什么新闻了么？}
#{197}{}{Tell me more about the Circle.}
{197}{}{给我详细介绍下工会。}
#{198}{}{I'm looking for the missing caravans. Any suggestions?}
{198}{}{我在找失踪的商队。有线索么？}
#{199}{LOX_35}{Well, the whole bloody town's in an uproar, what with the missing caravans and all.  Something of a pain.  Cuts into the Circle's business, don't you know?}
{199}{LOX_35}{呃，全城都他妈的因为失踪的商队而骚动了。这有点痛苦。断了盗贼工会的财路，知道么？}
#{200}{}{Do you know who might be responsible?}
{200}{}{你知道是谁干得么？}
#{201}{}{Thanks. Can I ask you some more questions?}
{201}{}{谢谢。我能再问几个问题么？}
#{202}{LOX_36}{I don't know, but I hope they find out soon.  People are edgy and it makes our job a bit more sticky, say what?  Not to mention all the superstitious nonsense floating about.}
{202}{LOX_36}{不知道，不过我希望他们能尽快查清楚。人们很不安，这让我们的工作有点棘手，说什么？别提那些外边散布的迷信鬼话。}
#{203}{}{What kind of nonsense?}
{203}{}{什么样的鬼话？}
#{204}{}{Thanks. Can I ask you some more questions?}
{204}{}{谢谢。我能再问几个问题么？}
#{205}{LOX_37}{Oh, some bosh and bother that the Death Claw grabbed the caravans, and brought them up to its lair for an afternoon tea.}
{205}{LOX_37}{哦，一些让人不爽的谣言说商队被死亡爪抓到它们的洞穴当点心了。}
#{206}{}{Sounds yummy. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{206}{}{听起来不错。我能再问几个问题么？}
#{207}{LOX_38A}{Oh, absolutely.  We're all friends here.}
{207}{LOX_38A}{啊，没问题。我们现在是朋友。}
#{208}{lox_38b}{[Sigh]  Why not?}
{208}{lox_38b}{【叹气】好吧。}
#{209}{LOX_38C}{Ask away, ask away.}
{209}{LOX_38C}{快问，快问。}
#{210}{LOX_39}{No, actually.  You had one.  Consider yourself lucky.  Goodbye, ta-ta.}
{210}{LOX_39}{实际上不行了。你已经问了一个。自求多福吧。后会有期。}
#{211}{lox_40}{Nothing you'd be interested in.}
{211}{lox_40}{没什么你感兴趣的。}
#{212}{}{Try me.}
{212}{}{试试我}
#{213}{}{Okay, thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{213}{}{哦，谢谢。我能再问几个问题么？}
#{214}{LOX_41}{Oh nothing.  Just the whole damn town's been up in arms with all the missing caravans.  That's all.}
{214}{LOX_41}{没啥。不过是全城都他妈的因为失踪商队的事而武装了起来。就这点事。}
#{215}{}{Gee, thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{215}{}{啊，谢谢。我能再问几个问题么？}
#{216}{LOX_42}{Oh, just the usual.  The merchant caravans get fat off the poor, while that villain Decker plays off everyone.}
{216}{LOX_42}{啊，和往常一样。旅行队商人越来越富，恶棍德克凌驾于全城之上。}
#{217}{LOX_43}{Well, you've got the usual numbers of shops and things.  Mix in some Children of the Cathedral nut cases.  Add a dollop of Decker and his underground making life hard for us all.  Top it with a sprinkle of greedy merchants and that will just about cover it.}
{217}{LOX_43}{嗯，你可以找到数量一般的商店和物资。大教堂那些麻烦家伙的崽子是个问题。外带德克帮和他的地下活动让我们更加难过。地上被一些贪婪的商人占据着，这就是大概情况吧。}
#{218}{}{Merchants are pretty much scum, huh?}
{218}{}{商人就是一堆极品杂碎，对吧？}
#{219}{}{Sounds like you're a real Decker supporter.}
{219}{}{听起来你支持德克帮。}
#{220}{LOX_43A}{Next question, please.}
{220}{LOX_43A}{请进入下一问题。}
#{221}{LOX_44}{Too right!  That's why the Circle was formed, you see.  You got all those rich buggers, feeding off the poor.  And those poor are just waiting for a hero.  Because of the help we give them, they practically bow at our feet.}
{221}{LOX_44}{太对了！这就是盗贼工会成立的原因，明白吧。让那些有钱的H屁眼一族来养活我们这些穷人。这些穷人不过是在等待一个英雄。因为我们给予他们的帮助，他们其实在我们脚下俯首称臣。}
#{222}{}{What's wrong with making money?}
{222}{}{捞钱有什么不对？}
#{223}{}{Just like Robin Hood.}
{223}{}{就像罗宾汉。}
#{224}{LOX_47}{What's the harm?!  you little...well, I was wrong about you, wasn't I?  Jasmine, show this merchant's boot licker the door!}
{224}{LOX_47}{有什么不对？！你个……算了，我错看你了，不是么？茉莉，把这个商人的走狗请出去！}
#{225}{LOX_48}{You know the story!  I knew there was something special about you.  Ah, me granddad told that one a long time ago.  Now there was a thief!  But enough of that.  Anything else you need to ask?}
{225}{LOX_48}{你知道那个故事的！我知道你比较特殊。啊，那是我爷爷很久以前告诉我的。现在这有个贼了！好了，暂且打住。你还需要问什么？}
#{226}{LOX_51}{Other than the missing caravans, not much.  Oh, wait.  One of my lads came back yesterday all a-glow with a touch of radiation poisoning.  Nasty business.  Probably tip-toed a bit too close to the old Hot Spot.}
{226}{LOX_51}{除了失踪商队的事，没什么了。啊，等下。我有个兄弟昨天全身放光的带着辐射回来了。真恶心。可能他要和他的脚趾头永别了。}
#{227}{LOX_53}{We steal from the rich, plain and simple.  We give about, oh, ten to twenty percent to the poor folks over in Old Town.  The Circle keeps twenty, which leaves the rest for the thief.  Not a bad deal all round.}
{227}{LOX_53}{我们偷那些有钱、普通且容易得手的。我们把大约，呃，１０％到２０％分给旧城区的穷人。组织保留２０％，其余留给那个盗贼。还算公平合理。}
#{228}{LOX_54}{We're a bunch of crooks!  What did you think we were, a bunch of cooks?}
{228}{LOX_54}{我们是一群小流氓！你认为我们是什么？一群厨子？}
#{229}{LOX_55A}{You could check with the merchants, although your time would be better spent sizing them up for some night removal work.  While I think it's absolute bunk, ask around about the Death Claw.  Or even follow a caravan out, if you've totally lost your mind.}
{229}{LOX_55A}{你可以和商人们谈谈，虽然你只是聊聊他们的死亡之旅更好。不过我认为这太扯了，你去打听下死亡之爪。或者如果你真的脑子进水了就直接跟一队商人出去。}
#{230}{LOX_55B}{Well, how the bloody hell should I know?  Do I look like a merchant?}
{230}{LOX_55B}{哈，我他妈的怎么会知道？我看起来像个商人么？}
#{231}{LOX_56}{Couple of ground rules.  One, don't ever get caught, and two, never, ever steal from the Circle.  Put it down.}
{231}{LOX_56}{有几条规矩。第一，何时也别被抓祝第二，永远、永远也不准从工会偷东西。严禁此种行为。}
#{232}{LOX_57}{You just don't have the hang of this, do you?  Jasmine, the door for our foolish friend and don't let me see that face again.}
{232}{LOX_57}{你就是不知道如何搞定它，是么？茉莉，送我们的傻兄弟出门，别让我再看见他。}
#{233}{LOX_58}{I don't think you quite understand.  Save it for the merchants, yes?}
{233}{LOX_58}{我不认为你真的明白了。把它留给商人，是么？}
#{234}{LOX_59}{What the bloody hell are you doing in here?  Get out!}
{234}{LOX_59}{你在这搞破坏？滚！}
#{235}{LOX_60}{You see, it's like I said...}
{235}{LOX_60}{你瞧，这就像我说．．．}
#{236}{LOX_61}{Well, as I said...}
{236}{LOX_61}{好吧，既然我说．．．}
#{237}{LOX_62}{Are you just thick?  I told you...}
{237}{LOX_62}{你是不真的傻了？我跟你说．．．}
#{238}{LOX_63}{Which are you, deaf or stupid?  Like I said...}
{238}{LOX_63}{你是聋子还是白痴？就像我说的．．．}
#{239}{LOX_64}{It's no fun repeating myself.}
{239}{LOX_64}{再说一次可不好玩。}
#{240}{LOX_65}{Ugh!  It's no use.  Obviously no amount of pounding can possibly get that information into your thick skull.}
{240}{LOX_65}{唉！没办法。显然无论如何也没法把这些东西灌输进你这个蠢脑壳里了。}
#{241}{LOX_66}{No.  Decker's a slick one.  He's got the whole town in his pocket, he does.  He gives his 'protection' to the merchants, all the while pitting them against each other.  Not someone you want to mess with, but he can usually be found in the Maltese Falcon.}
{241}{LOX_66}{不。德克是个老油条。他玩弄全镇于鼓掌之间，真的。他罩着商人们，一直叫他们互相争斗。那家伙可不是你想与之为伍的那种，不过你可以在}
#{242}{LOX_67}{He's a gun dealer up in the north part of Old Town.  Damn dangerous bloke, some of his hardware's a bit too lethal.}
{242}{LOX_67}{他是旧城区北部的一个枪商。很他妈危险的家伙，他的一些货可不是闹着玩的。}
#{243}{LOX_68}{Not too fond of us actually.}
{243}{LOX_68}{实际上不是很喜欢我们。}
#{244}{LOX_69}{Harold?  He's a good enough sort, for being a ghoul an all.  Lives on the south side.}
{244}{LOX_69}{哈罗德？从做为一个僵尸的角度讲，那小子还不错。他住在南边。}
#{245}{LOX_70}{Decker's right hand man, definitely not one to mess with.  You can usually find him at the Maltese Falcon.}
{245}{LOX_70}{德克的左右手，不适合交往的人。你一般能在找到他。}
#{246}{LOX_71}{Them.  Sitting high and mighty in their Water Tower south of downtown, charging all us decent folks for any drop of water that springs from the ground.  They should all be bloody shot, they should.}
{246}{LOX_71}{他们。牛潞婧娴淖在他们位于市中心南部的水塔里边，为了每一滴从地上冒出来的水向我们收费。他们都该他妈的拖出去枪毙，绝对的。}
#{247}{LOX_72}{They have a little general shop downtown.  Can't trust'em, though.  Hiding in their bloody warehouse most of the time.  They do sell some mean drugs and medkits, though.  A lot cheaper than the stupid Children of the Cathedral, I can tell you that.}
{247}{LOX_72}{他们在市中心开了个杂货店。虽然不值得信任。他们一般都躲在那个狗窝仓库里。不过，他们卖一些劣质毒品和药品。比大教堂的崽子都便宜。这就是我能告诉你的。}
#{248}{LOX_73}{The closest thing to decent of all the three caravans.  Only missed it by a few miles.}
{248}{LOX_73}{这很靠近三个商队。仅仅几里地。}
#{249}{LOX_74}{Criminals.  Absolute criminals.  They're squeezing the life out of the town.  The Far Go Traders, the Crimson Caravan, and the worst of the bunch, the Water Merchants.  You can have the lot.}
{249}{LOX_74}{罪恶。当然是罪恶。它们使生气远离这座城镇。旅行商，深红商队，还有最垃圾的一群，供水商。你可以看到很多。}
#{250}{lox_75}{It's down in the middle of town.}
{250}{lox_75}{它坐落在市中心。}
#{251}{LOX_76}{Not much to tell, really.  Nighttime, scare your children stories about a beastie living up north and feeding on the flesh of bad little children everywhere.}
{251}{LOX_76}{真没什么好说的。半夜，用来吓小孩的故事－一头住在北边的野兽到处寻觅坏小孩当食物。}
#{252}{LOX_77}{Seems like every day another one turns up missing.  People are afraid to leave town without protection.  Some even blame it on the Death Claw.}
{252}{LOX_77}{似乎每天都有人被发现失踪。人们害怕在没有护卫的情况下离开城市。有的人把这归咎于死亡之爪。}
#{253}{LOX_78}{About three years ago, one of the merchants went way down south looking for other towns.  He came back all hair and teeth falling out, babbling about some huge span of radiation.  Who knows, maybe something special down there before the war.}
{253}{LOX_78}{大约三年前，一个商人南下去寻找其他城镇。他全身带着辐射归来，自称发现了范围巨大的辐射地域。谁知道呢，没准站前真有东西落在那。}
#{254}{LOX_79}{Most of the poor who work for the merchants live here, in buildings so thin they don't block the sun.  Meanwhile, those rich bastards are comfortable in their nice homes over in the Heights.  Makes me ill.}
{254}{LOX_79}{为商人们工作的穷人住在破到连太阳都挡不住的房子里。而那些富人杂种安详的住在他们富人区的大房子里。让我不爽。}
#{255}{LOX_80}{Fancy buildings.  Bought with the blood of the poor.}
{255}{LOX_80}{很棒的房子。用穷人们的血汗换来的。}
#{256}{LOX_81}{You can always find Bob in the direct center of the Merchant's Market.  He'll probably be selling those Iguana Bits of his till he keels over dead.}
{256}{LOX_81}{你总能在商业市场的管理中心找到鲍勃。如果他还活着，他很可能在卖他的蜥蜴串。}
#{257}{LOX_82}{Now there's a scary bunch.  They strut around all day talking about their Night God, as if he's the next best thing since merchant pockets with holes.  They can heal you up pretty cheap.  I'll give'em that.  You can find'em in that hospital of theirs downtown.}
{257}{LOX_82}{目前有让人很不安的一伙人。他们整天到处肆意宣扬他们的死神理论，就好想这是自商人们的口袋破了洞之后的又一好事。他们可以廉价的帮你看病。我觉得很值。你可以在他们市中心的医院找到他们。}
#{258}{LOX_83}{Oh, another bunch of wackos.  They sit up in their big black fortress to the north, just waiting for another war.}
{258}{LOX_83}{呃，又一群怪人。他们呆在他们北部的阴暗的大堡垒里，就等着下一次战争爆发。}
#{259}{LOX_84}{Need to be a bit careful there.  The Rippers and the Blades like to carve you up just for fun.  While the town there, Adytum, just tries to stay alive.  If you find yourself traipsing around there and happen on the Blades, make sure to say cheers to Razor for me.  Thinking of her brings back memories, it does.}
{259}{LOX_84}{在那你最好小心点。莱普士帮和利刃帮可能为了想找乐就把你剁了。那边，密室就是为了活命。如果你在那边闲逛正好碰上了利刃帮，别忘了帮我向剃刀问好。这话题勾起了我的回忆，真的。}
#{260}{LOX_85}{They're the scrapheads down in the Boneyard.  They've been fighting for years, and they don't even know what for anymore.  Bloody stupid it is.}
{260}{LOX_85}{他们是晒骨场的一群废物。他们打了好几年，不过却不知道为什么要打。真他妈的蠢。}
#{261}{LOX_86}{Oh, what a woman!  She used to be a thief here, until she decided to move down south to the Boneyard.  Last I heard she joined up with the Blades.  Ah, well, brains weren't her strongest part.}
{261}{LOX_86}{哦，那个女人！她过去是工会的成员，后来她决定南下去晒骨场。最近听说她加入了利刃帮。啊，她确实脑子不太灵光。}
#{262}{LOX_87}{Hmm, I haven't the foggiest.}
{262}{LOX_87}{唔，我也不太清楚。}
#{263}{LOX_88}{I really don't know.}
