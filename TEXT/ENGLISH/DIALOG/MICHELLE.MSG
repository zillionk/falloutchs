#{106}{}{You think that might be Scars.}
{106}{}{你觉得那是些伤疤。}
#{107}{}{You think that might be Gunner.}

#{110}{}{You think that might be Razor.}
{110}{}{你觉得那是剃刀。}
#{111}{}{What are you doing here?}
{111}{}{你在这做什么呢？}
#{112}{}{Hhrrrnnn.}
{112}{}{呵呵呵。}
#{113}{}{Nothing. Honest.}
{113}{}{没什么。老兄。}
#{114}{}{I'm just looking around.}
{114}{}{我随便逛逛。}
#{115}{}{This! *smack*}
{115}{}{这个！【啧啧啧】}
#{116}{}{A moron. I think that you'd best get out of here. Otherwise,
# you may become target practice.}
{116}{}{白痴。我想你最好快离开这儿。不然，你会变成练习的靶子。}
#{117}{}{Arroo!}
{117}{}{啊哦！}
#{118}{}{Arook.}
{118}{}{啊喔！}
#{119}{}{Nothing, eh? I think you're hiding something. Out with it
# before you see your guts.}
{119}{}{没什么，嗯？我看你藏了什么. 在你看到你的内脏之前把它拿出来。}
#{120}{}{I'm really a Martian.}
{120}{}{我真是火星人。}
#{121}{}{I'm here to stop the gang wars.}
{121}{}{我来这阻止帮派争斗。}
#{122}{}{I'm not up to anything.}
{122}{}{我什么也不在乎。}
#{123}{}{I'm up to THIS! *smack*}
{123}{}{我在乎这个！【啧啧啧】}
#{124}{}{Everyone knows there are no such things as Martians.
# All real aliens are from Venus. Now, you die!}
{124}{}{谁都知道没有火星人这玩意。所有真正的外星人是从金星来的。现在，你去死吧！}
#{125}{}{Sure, and I'm the Queen of Mexico.}
{125}{}{没错，我就是墨西哥女王。}
#{126}{}{Honest. I want to stop the wars so I can help Adytum.}
{126}{}{老兄。我要阻止争斗，所以会帮内城区。}
#{127}{}{Your Majesty, I truly seek to end the wars.}
{127}{}{兄台，我真的期待结束争斗。}
#{128}{}{If your intelligence were greater, I would try to
# explain the benefits of peace.}
{128}{}{如果你的智商够高，我会试试解释和平的好处。}
#{129}{}{If you're here to do that, then you'll need to try and find
# Razor. She'll let you know what we think of that.}
{129}{}{如果你在这做那个，你应该去找找剃刀。她会让你知道我们怎么想那个的。}
#{130}{}{Uh, thanks. I think.}
{130}{}{啊，多谢。我想。}
#{131}{}{Okay. Good bye.}
{131}{}{好。再见。}
#{132}{}{Mock me, will you? I guess I should expect as much from a
# child. Oh, by the way. Here!}
{132}{}{骗我，是不是？我猜我应该和小孩子期待得一样多。哦，随便提提。现在！} 
#{133}{}{Fancy talk will only get you so far. Here, it will get
# you about six feet under.}
{133}{}{愉快的谈天就到这了。现在，埋了你的时间到了。}
#{134}{}{If you are up to nothing, then we will put you up to
# something. I think 'target' makes a good something.}
{134}{}{如果你什么也不在乎，我们会让你在乎的。我想“靶子”会是个不错的东西。}
#{135}{}{You looked. Now, what do you want? Think quick. It may mean
# the difference between walking out of here and becoming
# a permanent resident.}
{135}{}{你看过了。现在，你想要什么？快点。离开这里和永久定居是不一样的。}
#{136}{}{I'd like to live here.}
{136}{}{我喜欢在这里生活。}
#{137}{}{I'm really a Ripper in disguise.}

{138}{}{我想给帮派们带来和平。}
#{139}{}{Leaving.}
{139}{}{正在离开。}
#{140}{}{Nothing special. Just looking at the garbage to be
# recycled.}
{140}{}{没什么特别的。就看看垃圾回收。}
#{141}{}{We never said anything about living. You would just
# reside here. Indefinitely. Enjoy your stay.}
{141}{}{我们不谈生活了。你就住这吧。没期限的。好好享受。}
#{142}{}{I'm glad you said that. I've been meaning to sharpen this. }
{142}{}{我很高兴你这么说。我想把这个弄得更锋利。}
#{143}{}{Soon I will have a hide to sharpen it on.}
{143}{}{很快我就会有块皮把它弄得更锋利。}
#{144}{}{Not so fast. The only way someone leaves here is if they
# are a Blade, or in a bag.}
{144}{}{没这么快。人们离开这里的唯一办法是成为利刃帮的人，或者装在袋子里。}
#{145}{}{Then I want to be a Blade.}
{145}{}{那么我想加入利刃帮。}
#{146}{}{How big is this bag?}
{146}{}{这袋子有多大？}
#{147}{}{You forget the third option. Me!}
{147}{}{你忘了第三种选择。我！}
#{148}{}{Fat chance. But, he's a test. If you can find Razor, then
# you can talk to her about that.}
{148}{}{不错的选择。不过，有个测验。如果你找到剃刀，可以和她谈谈测验的事。}
#{149}{}{Big enough to stuff your body parts in when we finish.}
{149}{}{我们做完的时候可以大的足够装下你。}
#{150}{}{I am not Sleeping Beauty. I do not need to be awakened.
# Get out or die.}
{150}{}{我不是睡美人。我不要被叫醒。滚出去，不然去死。}
#{151}{}{Hear you're out for the bastard's head. Give him an extra
# knife twist for me.}
{151}{}{听说你来取恶棍的首级。替我多给他来一刀。}
#{152}{}{Welcome back. The Hole is open and ready to house you once more.}
{152}{}{欢迎回来。旅馆再次为你服务。}
