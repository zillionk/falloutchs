# {100}{}{You see a peasant.}
# {101}{}{Oh, yeah, big man running from a scary dog. Phil, you sure showed it. Yep, you sure did.}
# {102}{}{What are you doing, Phil? You're checking the tread on those sneakers, aren't you?}
# {103}{}{Man, that dog looks hungry. It sure wants to eat you alive, Phil.}
# {104}{}{That might be a little overkill for a poor defenseless animal, don'cha think?}
# {105}{}{That sure is a nice pooch you have there.}
# {106}{}{I'm sure Phil would appreciate it if you were to get rid of his dog.}
# {107}{}{Thanks for dealing with that dog.}
# {108}{}{You see Lenore.}
{100}{}{你看到一个农民。}
{101}{}{哦耶, 一个大男人追着一条狗跑。菲尔，你刚才看上去很傻。是的，你很傻。}
{102}{}{你在干什么，菲尔？你在检查你的鞋底？是那样吗？}
{103}{}{伙计，那条狗好像很饿，它当然想要吃了你，菲尔。}
{104}{}{这条连自己都不能保护的狗又能造成多大伤害，你说呢？}
{105}{}{你看那肯定是一条好狗。}
{106}{}{我确定菲尔更希望你能帮他摆脱那条狗。}
{107}{}{谢谢你处理了那条狗。}
{108}{}{你看到勒诺。}
