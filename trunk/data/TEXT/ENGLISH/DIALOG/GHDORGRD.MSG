# {100}{}{You see a ghoul guard.}
# {101}{}{Go away! You're not wanted here.}
# {102}{}{OK. Nice meeting you, too.}
# {103}{}{Huh?}
# {104}{}{I'm on duty. If you want to see Set, you gotta do it inside.}
# {105}{}{The door is locked. You'll have to come back later when it's dark.}
# {106}{}{Thanks.}
# {107}{}{Huh?}
# {108}{}{I told you to leave. Your kind is not wanted here.}
# {109}{}{Right.}
# {110}{}{Myuh!}
# {111}{}{The doors don't open until dark.}
# {112}{}{I need to get in there. Is there any way you can help me?}
# {113}{}{Hmm, OK.}
# {114}{}{Ugh!}
# {115}{}{Well, I guess it can't hurt.}
# {116}{}{I wish I could help you, but Set would tan my ass if I did. You know how it is . . . always gotta do what the big guy says.}
# {117}{}{Yeah, I understand. Thanks.}
{100}{}{你看到一个僵尸警卫。}
{101}{}{离开那！你不能靠近那里。}
{102}{}{好的，见到你我也很高兴。}
{103}{}{啊？}
{104}{}{我是个看守，你要见赛特就到里面找他。}
{105}{}{这扇门是锁着的。你要在天黑的时候再回来看看。}
{106}{}{多谢。}
{107}{}{啊？}
{108}{}{我说过让你离开了，你在这里不受欢迎。}
{109}{}{正确。}
{110}{}{噢！}
{111}{}{黑夜之前这门不会开了。}
{112}{}{我需要进去，你有什么办法帮我吗？}
{113}{}{嗯，好吧。}
{114}{}{啊！}
{115}{}{好吧，我猜那没什么大不了吧。}
{116}{}{我很想帮你，但是如果我帮了，赛特会踢烂我的屁股，你知道那会是什么样的．．．必须服从他的命令。}
{117}{}{是的，我了解，谢谢。}
