#{100}{}{You see a peasant.}
#{101}{}{You see Phil.}
#{102}{}{It ain't my dog!}
#{103}{}{Damn right, shoot that beast!}
#{104}{}{I wouldn't trust that beast, if I was you. That thing is a killer.}
#{105}{}{Mister,}
#{106}{}{Ma'am,}
#{107}{}{ I would be really happy if you were to get rid of that damn dog.}
#{108}{}{Why?}
#{109}{}{Nah, I only deal with important stuff.}
#{110}{}{Where did it come from?}
#{111}{}{Hnnn.}
#{112}{}{Mebbe you can talk it to death.}
#{113}{}{It won't let us back into our house, that's why.}
#{114}{}{Okay.}
#{115}{}{Isn't it your dog?}
#{116}{}{It was the 'pet' of a traveller. When the traveller died, this
# damn dog just plopped its furry ass down on my doorstep
# and wouldn't leave. It's been there for days.}
#{117}{}{Oh.}
#{118}{}{Who was this traveller?}
#{119}{}{What did the traveller look like?}
#{120}{}{I don't know. Some guy. He came from the east, he said.
# Like anyone could get past the deadlands to the east.
# He ran afoul of Gizmo, trying to interfere with Gizmo's
# business.}
#{121}{}{So, Gizmo had a couple of boys beat him up and throw him from
# the casino roof. The traveller broke his damnfool neck and
# died. The dog was pissed.}
#{122}{}{What did the traveller look like?}
#{123}{}{Oh, the guy was tall, dark-haired with a little graying
# around the edges. He was dressed all in black leather,
# like that's a good idea in the desert, and carried
# a shotgun.}
#{124}{}{He had some funny accent. The dog was his constant companion,
# followed him everywhere.}
#{125}{}{Appreciate the gossip.}
#{126}{}{I hate that dog.}

#{127}{}{Thanks for your help.}

#{128}{}{Help us!}
#{129}{}{We are being attacked!}
#{130}{}{Thank you for helping us defend against those damn drunken raiders. For #helping us we award you these }
#{131}{}{ caps.}
#{132}{}{We thank you for your help! We pooled these }
#{133}{}{ caps together and award them to you for help in defending us against that #scum.}

{100}{}{你看到一个农夫。}
{101}{}{你看到菲儿。}
{102}{}{这不是我的狗。}
{103}{}{太他妈对了，射它。}
{104}{}{如果我是你的话我绝对不信任那畜生。它会杀人的。}
{105}{}{先生，}
{106}{}{女士，}
{107}{}{要是你能弄走那狗就太好了。}
{108}{}{为什么？}
{109}{}{恩，我是只做大事的。}
{110}{}{它从哪来的？}
{111}{}{哎……}
{112}{}{没准你可以说死它。}
{113}{}{它不让我们回屋子，你没看见吗？}
{114}{}{好吧。}
{115}{}{这不是你们的狗？}
{116}{}{它是某个旅者的“宠物”。 可旅者挂了之后，这死狗就好象把自己的毛屁股种在我
#们门前了一样，一步也不挪。已经好几天了。}
{117}{}{哦。}
{118}{}{那旅者是谁啊？}
{119}{}{那旅者什么样？}
{120}{}{我不知道。一个男的。他从东边来，听他的口气好象穿越那片死亡地就跟玩儿似的。#他和吉斯莫起了冲突，想搅吉斯莫的生意。}
{121}{}{吉斯莫就让几个手下海扁了他一顿，然后把他从赌场顶上丢下来。那蠢货的脖子断
#掉挂了。这狗就疯了。}
{122}{}{那旅者长什么样？}
{123}{}{哦，那家伙挺高，深色头发，鬓发有点灰白。一身黑皮装，好象在沙漠里这么穿很
#不错似的，还带着把霰弹枪。}
{124}{}{他口音很奇怪。那狗对他死心塌地的，走到哪儿跟到哪儿。}
{125}{}{谢谢跟我聊天。}
{126}{}{我恨那狗。}

{127}{}{谢谢帮忙}
