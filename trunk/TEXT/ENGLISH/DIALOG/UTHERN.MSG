#{105}{}{Really? You claim yourself better, but what proof do you have?}

{107}{}{你的种族存在这么久是个奇迹。我将以你的净化开始。}

#{114}{}{Though you are foolish, I was referring to your manner of delivering words.}
{114}{}{你可真蠢，我刚才指的是你的说话态度。}

#{115}{}{Ah, the fool finally realizes something.}
{115}{}{啊哈，傻瓜最后还是开了点窍。}

#{116}{}{Words will only do so much. This will solve more.}
{116}{}{废话就只能到此为止了。这个更管用。}

#{117}{}{I begin to think you may have a bit of superior blood in you yet. Let me find out for certain.}
{117}{}{我觉得你身上可能还有一些高级血统。我要确认一下。}

#{118}{}{He does indeed, for death shall be your saving grace.}
{118}{}{他的确做了, 死亡将是你最为可取之处。}

#{119}{}{The simplest of proofs for you. I am smarter, stronger, and quicker than you are. Would you care for a test of my skills?}
{119}{}{最简单的证据就是：我比你更灵活，更强壮，更快。你要不要对我的能力来个测试？}

#{124}{}{You bet!}
{124}{}{当然！}

#{125}{}{No way!}
{125}{}{不可能！}

#{126}{}{I'm not sure about this.}
{126}{}{我没想好。}

#{127}{}{Die!}

#{128}{}{Then i will take you to my master.}
{128}{}{那么我带你去见我的主教。}

#{129}{}{It almost seems a pity. No matter, this won't take long.}
{129}{}{这似乎是很遗憾的事情。不要紧，这过程不会要多久的。}

#{130}{}{Offered all the power in the world and still frightened. I will help you with your decision.}
{130}{}{就是掌握了全世界的力量还是惊恐不安的，我来帮你下决心吧。}

#{131}{}{Comments such as those only prove how much more intelligent i am than you. Now, you shall pay for your insolence!}
{131}{}{你的话正好证明了我比你更聪明。现在，你将为你的傲慢无礼付出代价！}

#{135}{}{What? I think I can generalize this much -- you are coming with me now.}
{135}{}{什么？我想我能概括这么多－－你现在跟我走。}

#{136}{}{How nice to see you again. I was told that you were roaming around here. I have orders to bring you in.}
{136}{}{再次见到你很高兴。我听说你在这附近转悠，上头有命令，让我带你去觐见。}
