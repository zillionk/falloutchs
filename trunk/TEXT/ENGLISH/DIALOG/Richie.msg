{113}{}{你这个哈勃城的官员真让我不舒服！巡视我老板的避难所！往下呢，交些奇怪的税？没有你这种当官的管这管那我们就活不了吗？总有一天我们会站起来。是的。总有一天我们平民会一起踢你们当官的屁股。然后把你们的财产都拿走嗯？等不及这么干了，顺便说一下，不是我一个人想这么干。我知道你仅仅是执行公务。我不想再看着你这张脸，再见。}

#{114}{}{Don't give me this crap! Get outta here now or I'll have to shoot you!}
{114}{}{别跟我说这种废话！再不闪开我就开枪了！}

#{115}{}{Oh yeah. Well no one pushes around Richie Glowsteader and gets away with it!}
{115}{}{哦太好了。胆敢和瑞奇大爷作对的人绝对不会有好下场！}

#{116}{}{Oh just about ten thousand Hub Bucks. Hope you weren't thinking of stealing it. I'd have to kill
# you. I almost killed someone once, so you don't want to mess with me!}
{116}{}{哦，一万个哈勃币。你妄想动这笔钱。我会杀了你的。上次已经把某个不知好歹的打了个半死，你别想！}

#{117}{}{Man, you're stupid. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Now let's try this again. "Yes" means I
# blow your head off. "No" means you get your butt out of here. Which is it going to be?}
{117}{}{伙计，你真是够蠢的。哦，对不起，我没有冒犯你的意思。现在我们换个方式说话。“是”的意思是我把你的头轰飞。“不是”的意思是你赶紧离开这里。你选择哪一个？}

#{118}{}{Ah . . . yes . . .}
{118}{}{嗯……是……}

#{119}{}{Uh?no}

#{121}{}{Man, I can't do it! It'd be like shooting a dumb animal. Just get outta here, okay?}
{121}{}{伙计，我不能那么做！我应该打死你这个没脑子的动物。现在快从这里离开，行吗？}

#{122}{}{That's good. Now run along now. I'm sure you might find someone to feed you}
{122}{}{很好。快跑。我会找人来修理你的！}
