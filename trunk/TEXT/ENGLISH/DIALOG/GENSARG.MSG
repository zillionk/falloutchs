{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

# {100}{}{Stop!}
# {101}{}{Die, human!}
# {102}{}{To the death.}
# {103}{}{You will pay for your sins!}
# {104}{}{I will crush you!}
# {105}{}{Unity forever!}
# {106}{}{For the Master!}
# {107}{}{You are not supposed to be armed in this area, little brother. Explain
 # yourself.}
# {108}{}{You are not supposed to be armed in this area, little sister. Explain
 # yourself.}
# {109}{}{Hngg.}
# {110}{}{It's okay, I work here.}
# {111}{}{It's okay, I have a pass.}
# {112}{}{I am armed by permission of the Lieutenant.}
# {113}{}{What manner of treason is this?!}
# {114}{}{Show me your pass, then.}
# {115}{}{I, uh, left it in my other robe.}
{100}{}{站住！}
{101}{}{死吧，人类！}
{102}{}{死去吧！}
{103}{}{你会为你的罪过付出代价！}
{104}{}{我要撕碎你！}
{105}{}{同一万岁！}
{106}{}{主教万岁！}
{107}{}{这里你不能带武器，小兄弟。请见谅。}
{108}{}{这里你不能带武器，小妹妹。请见谅。}
{109}{}{嗯！}
{110}{}{别那么紧张，我是在这干活的。}
{111}{}{别在意，我只是路过。}
{112}{}{我这么做是经过中尉许可的。}
{113}{}{难道你想造反吗？！}
{114}{}{那么出示通行证！}
{115}{}{呃，我把它忘在别的长袍里了。}
{116}{}{老老实实站在我的枪口下别动！}
# {116}{}{It's right here, stapled to the front of my gun.}
# {117}{}{Hurry on your task then, but be warned -- I'm watching you.}
# {118}{}{Yes, little brother. What is it that you need from me?}
# {119}{}{Yes, little sister. What is it that you need from me?}
# {120}{}{Hng!}
# {121}{}{Hmm, where's this Master guy?}
# {122}{}{Praise to the Unity, brother.}
# {123}{}{I am not one to guide you on the path to Unity. Leave!}
# {124}{}{You are obviously a heathen! Pay for your sins!}
# {125}{}{Here is here. Why do you ask?}
# {126}{}{Oh, uh, no reason.}
# {127}{}{I am going to kick his ass from here to, uh, someplace really far away!}
# {128}{}{What question? I said 'Hail to the Master, goodbye.'}
# {129}{}{You insult me! Die!}
# {130}{}{Praise to the Unity.}
# {131}{}{You sound like you do not believe what you say. Could this be true?
 # Or have you left the path of righteous?}
# {132}{}{You mistake the tremor in my voice for fear when it is actually
 # a cold of some sort.}
# {133}{}{I think your kind is doomed, actually. Here, let me prove it with
 # some help from my friends . . .}
{117}{}{赶紧去干活，你最好别耍花样，我会一直盯着你的。}
{118}{}{啊，小兄弟，你想要什么？}
{119}{}{啊，小妹妹，你想要什么？}
{120}{}{嗯！}
{121}{}{那，这个叫主教的家伙在哪里？}
{122}{}{赞美同一，兄弟！}
{123}{}{我不是那个为你指点同一之道的人，离开吧！}
{124}{}{你这个异教徒！为你的罪行付出代价吧！}
{125}{}{这就是这，你干吗这么问？}
{126}{}{哦，啊，没什么。}
{127}{}{我真想在他的屁股上来一脚，呃，但是太远了我够不到}
{128}{}{什么问题？我就是去和主教打个招呼。}
{129}{}{你冒犯了我！死吧！}
{130}{}{赞美统一！}
{131}{}{你说的话连自己都不信，是不是？或者说你已经背弃了真理的道路？}
{132}{}{我声音发颤是因为天气冷，不是害怕，你别搞错了。}
{133}{}{你属于那一类天生应该完蛋的，我会在朋友的帮助下向你证明的……}
# {134}{}{When you become one of us, you will not fear such minor things.
 # Begone.}
# {135}{}{What do you want this time? I have little time for your talk.}
# {136}{}{Labbo!}
# {137}{}{I have little time for your life . . . Die!}
# {138}{}{Nothing, sorry.}
# {139}{}{Praise to the Unity, brother.}
# {140}{}{You are obviously an intruder!}
# {141}{}{Get out of my face.}
# {142}{}{I don't have time for you. Stop bothering me.}
# {200}{}{You see a Super Mutant Sargeant.}
# {201}{}{Hey, this looks like a nuclear bomb. Why is it here?}
# {202}{}{This is our Master's weapon of last resort. If we find
 # an enemy we cannot defeat in battle, then we will destroy them
 # with this. But I doubt this will ever happen. Even our Master
 # does not want to unleash the dreaded power of the atom again!}
# {203}{}{Ok, thanks.}
# {204}{}{Is it functional?}
# {205}{}{You're welcome. Now be quiet, I need to concentrate on
 # guarding this device.}
# {206}{}{Oh, yes, it is. We keep it in perfect working condition,
 # ready to be detonated at a moment's notice. The Unity will not
 # be defeated!}
{134}{}{当你成为我们的一员后，就不再会害怕这些小东西了，可怜虫。}
{135}{}{你这次又想要什么？我没空搭理你。}
{136}{}{干活去！}
{137}{}{我没工夫浪费在你的小命上了，去死吧！}
{138}{}{没有什么，对不住了。}
{139}{}{赞美同一，兄弟！}
{140}{}{显然，你是个入侵！}
{141}{}{从我眼前消失！}
{142}{}{没空搭理你！别来烦我！}
{200}{}{一个超级变种人队长。}
{201}{}{嘿，这东西看起来是个核弹，怎么弄来的？}
{202}{}{这是主教用来最终圣战的武器，如果碰到寻常战斗不可能战胜的对手，我们就可以使用这件神器取胜，不过你知道这种事情不可能发生的，就是主教也不想再使用毁灭性武器了。}
{203}{}{好的，谢谢。}
{204}{}{这东西还能用吗？}
{205}{}{不客气，不过请闭嘴吧，我要集中精力看着设备。}
{206}{}{哦，对，就那么回事，我们让它处于良好的运行状态，能在任何需要的时刻引爆。我们是不可战胜的！}
# {207}{}{Ah, thanks.}
# {208}{}{Aren't you worried that someone could steal some robes
 # and sneak in here to set it off?}
# {209}{}{No. We are here to guard it from intruders. No one could
 # access the device without us noticing. Besides, the nuclear arming
 # key required to arm the device is not here.}
# {210}{}{Oh, that makes sense. Thanks.}
# {211}{}{Well, for my sense of safety, could you tell me where the
 # key is located?}
# {212}{}{Oh, sure, no problem. The Lieutenant keeps the key. He's
 # at the Military Base, so he isn't even around here. That keeps
 # the nuclear bomb from being set off under our beloved Master.}
# {213}{}{Thanks for your time.}
# {214}{}{【The large mutant peers at you for a moment, with bushy
 # eyebrows raised】 I think you are asking too many questions.}
{207}{}{啊，多谢。}
{208}{}{你们就不担心有人潜入进来破坏设备？}
{209}{}{我们在这就是预防入侵者的，没有人可以瞒过我的眼睛接近设备。还有，启动系统的密钥保存在很隐秘的地方。}
{210}{}{哦，如我所见，谢谢了！}
{211}{}{哦，我看这样够安全了，介意告诉我你们把密钥放在哪里了吗？}
{212}{}{当然没问题，中尉负责保管密钥。他在军事基地里边，他根本就不在这，这保证了核弹在我们敬爱的主教的安全控制中。}
{213}{}{谢谢你。}
{214}{}{【巨大的变种人盯了你一会后瞪大了眼睛】你的问题太多了。}
