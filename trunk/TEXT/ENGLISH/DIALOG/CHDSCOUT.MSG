{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}


#{120}{}{Wasting my time, I see. Get lost!}
#{121}{}{Vaut. Vaut? What's a vaut?}
#{122}{}{Numnum.}
#{123}{}{Nonah.}
#{124}{}{Valt! Valt!}
#{125}{}{Oh, you want candy. Sorry, I don't have any. Goodbye.}
#{126}{}{Oh, a Vault. I'm sure that is very nice. Maybe you can talk to one
# of my superiors about that. I'm kinda busy right now.}
#{127}{}{It is very dangerous here. Big, bad monsters took over this place.
# We are trying to save what we can before they come back.}
#{128}{}{No go! No go!}
#{129}{}{Uh, oh.}
#{130}{}{Bubye.}
#{131}{}{Okay. Suit yourself. When they get back here, you can be their dinner.}
#{132}{}{Me kill! Me kill!}
#{133}{}{Bubye.}
#{134}{}{You can try. I'm not sure you will get very far, though. Good luck to you.}
#{135}{}{Uh oh is right. They are nasty. We are trying to make them understand
# that people and monsters can live together.}
#{136}{}{Oh. OK. Bubye.}
#{137}{}{Just tell me who you are before I blow off your head.}
#{138}{}{I'm a Follower. Where did everyone go?}
#{139}{}{I'm one of you. Now let me pass.}
#{140}{}{I am }
#{141}{}{. Remember it!}
#{142}{}{I don't have to.}
#{143}{}{DIE!!!}
#{144}{}{Come with me. I'll show you where everyone else went.}
#{145}{}{So, you are a Follower?}
#{146}{}{Of course! Who else would I be?}
#{147}{}{No, I am a Children member.}
#{148}{}{Silly me. I mistook you for someone else. Come with me. I'll show
# you the way.}
#{149}{}{I don't remember you. What's the name?}
#{150}{}{I'm }
#{151}{}{. How could you forget about me?}
#{152}{}{None of your business.}
#{153}{}{I'm your worst nightmare.}
#{154}{}{I'm sorry. I still don't remember you. Maybe someone else may remember
# who you are.}
#{155}{}{Yes, I remember you. We were told to look for you. Vengeance shall be mine!}
#{156}{}{You are in my patrol area. It is my business. Talk or die!}
#{157}{}{Fine. I'm }
#{158}{}{. Ring a bell yet?}
#{159}{}{Hmmm. I think . . . KILL!}
#{160}{}{Let me think.}
#{161}{}{Now let me see. It's }
#{162}{}{. Right?}
#{163}{}{Yes, you moron.}
#{164}{}{Yes.}
#{165}{}{No stupid. It's Deathstalker!}
#{166}{}{Good. Just making sure for your headstone.}
#{167}{}{Then I don't have to let you live. Good night.}
#{168}{}{And who are you?}
#{169}{}{I'm a Follower. Where did everyone go?}
#{170}{}{I'm one of you. Now let me pass.}
#{171}{}{I am }
#{172}{}{. Remember it!}
#{173}{}{I don't have to!}
#{174}{}{DIE!!!}
#{175}{}{Deathslayer, eh? You look more like worm bait to me.}
#{176}{}{If you are a friend, then prove it.}
#{177}{}{I helped kill the Followers.}
#{178}{}{I helped kill the Rippers.}
#{179}{}{I helped kill those mutant things.}
#{180}{}{I helped kill the Children.}
#{181}{}{Really? I think my boss would like to hear more about that.
# Go look for Orfeo. He'll be able to reward you for your help.}
#{182}{}{For someone who comes in peace, you do an awful lot of killing.
# But those Rippers were causing quite a bit of trouble. Orfeo can reward your
# for your aid.}
#{183}{}{You kill harmless creatures which are the end result of man's
# destructive nature and then claim peace?}
#{184}{}{I'm sorry. They were ugly, so I shot them.}
#{185}{}{They were hurting people all over the place.}
#{186}{}{Now I'm going to kill you.}
#{187}{}{I still let you live. I think I better take you in to have you
# cleansed of these thoughts of destruction.}
#{188}{}{Funny. I thought I saw some of them out in the street trying to
# clean up the gangs.}
#{189}{}{They attacked the Blades?}
#{190}{}{What happened to the Adytum?}
#{191}{}{Die, scum!}
#{192}{}{Those losers are now no more.}
#{193}{}{That's a good thing. Well, goodbye.}
#{194}{}{And now, you won't be either.}
#{195}{}{That's where I know you from. It's payback time!}
#{196}{}{It's you again. I thought you would have learned by now. Too little,
# too late, I guess.}

{101}{}{你是谁？}
{102}{}{我，我啊。}
{103}{}{你是谁？去哪儿？}
{104}{}{是我！}
{105}{}{我是死神！}
{106}{}{别紧张，我是朋友。}
{107}{}{我我？你赶紧给我滚！这里是大教堂教徒的私有地界。}
{108}{}{哈？我不走！}
{109}{}{哈？你去死！}
{110}{}{我不走我不走。}
{111}{}{好嘛。你是我遇见的最白痴的猪头，我能帮你做什么？}
{112}{}{过夜……夜！}
{113}{}{没事。}
{114}{}{帮你了。}
{115}{}{算了，你赶紧走，别逼我杀了你。}
{116}{}{你还能帮我？搞笑。你有什么要问的？}
{117}{}{那个那个。}
{118}{}{这个！}
{119}{}{避烂。}
##“避烂”这是傻瓜说的话，不要改！！
{120}{}{真是浪费我的时间，滚！}
{121}{}{避烂？避烂？什么是他妈的避烂啊？}
{122}{}{不不不。}
{123}{}{不细。}
{124}{}{避烂所！避烂所！}
{125}{}{哦，你想吃糖糖？抱歉，我没有。再见！}
{126}{}{“避难所”吧！这里是个好地方，你可以问问我的上司，我现在很忙。}
{127}{}{这里很恐怖哦！大大的坏坏的怪物住在这里哦！我们要在它们回来前拿宝贝哦！}
{128}{}{不走，我不走！}
{129}{}{啊，哦……}
{130}{}{再…再见。}
{131}{}{随你，它们回来就会把你吃了的。}
{132}{}{我杀了它们！我杀，我杀！}
{133}{}{再见。}
{134}{}{你可以试试，我觉得你撑不了多久，好运！}
{135}{}{呃，对啊。它们很混蛋的。我们一直想让它们明白怪物和人是可以和平相处的。}
{136}{}{好啊，好，再见。}
{137}{}{赶紧说你是谁，不然我一枪把你脑袋轰了。}
{138}{}{我是末世论者的信徒，人都去哪里了？}
{139}{}{我是你们的一员，让我过去。}
{140}{}{我是}
{141}{}{。你给我记好了！}
{142}{}{没这个必要吧。}
{143}{}{你去死！！！}
{144}{}{跟我来，我带你去其他人的所在。}
{145}{}{你是一个末世论者？}
{146}{}{当然，我还能是谁啊？}
{147}{}{不是，我是教徒的一员。}
{148}{}{我真是糊涂，把你误认为其它人了，跟我来，我给你带路。}
{149}{}{我记不起来了，你叫什么？}
{150}{}{我叫}
{151}{}{。你怎么会忘记我呢？}
{152}{}{这不关你的事情。}
{153}{}{我是你的恶梦。}
{154}{}{对不起，我还是记不起你，也许其它人会认得你。}
{155}{}{对了，想起来了，我们一直在找你！我今天就毙了你！}
{156}{}{你在我的巡逻区，这就关我的事！说清楚，要么死！}
{157}{}{好吧，我是}
{158}{}{。明白了？}
{159}{}{嗯，我想想……靠，是你！我杀！}
{160}{}{让我想想。}
{161}{}{等下，你是}
{162}{}{。对吧？}
{163}{}{没错，你这个白痴。}
{164}{}{对。}
{165}{}{别傻了。我是死神！}
{166}{}{很好，你的墓碑上的名字不会刻错了。}
{167}{}{那我就成全你！永别了！}
{168}{}{你是谁？}
{169}{}{我是末世论者。其他人呢？}
{170}{}{我是你们的一员，让我过去。}
{171}{}{我是}
{172}{}{。你给我记好了！}
{173}{}{没这个必要！}
{174}{}{去死！！}
{175}{}{死神，哈？在我眼里你是屎！}
{176}{}{朋友？你有什么能证明？}
{177}{}{我帮你们杀过末世论者。}
{178}{}{我帮你们杀过电锯党。}
{179}{}{我帮你们杀过变种人。}
{180}{}{我帮你们杀过教徒。}
{181}{}{是吗？我的老板也许可以和你进一步谈谈，去找奥佛吧，他也许会给你些奖赏。}
{182}{}{你沾了这么多人的血很可怕，但那些电锯党恶棍罪恶滔天，奥佛会表彰你的。}
{183}{}{这些无害的怪物本来就是人类毁灭本性的牺牲品，你却以杀戮它们取乐？}
{184}{}{对不起，它们太丑了，所以我灭了不少。}
{185}{}{它们到处危害人类啊！}
{186}{}{那我就灭了你！}
{187}{}{我今天就不杀你了。我希望你以后能净化你的毁灭思想。}
{188}{}{有趣，我记得有一些人在街头想扫灭帮派。}
{189}{}{他们攻击利刃帮？}
{190}{}{内城区出了什么事？}
{191}{}{去死！混蛋！}
{192}{}{那些混蛋都玩完了。}
{193}{}{这是好事啊。嗯，再见。}
{194}{}{现在，你也玩完了！}
{195}{}{我明白！你该遭报应了！}
{196}{}{又是你，我以为你会长点记性，没想到你偏不见棺材不落泪。}
