# {100}{}{This isn't right at all.}
# {101}{}{There we go.}
# {102}{}{The firing mechanism keeps jamming.}
# {103}{}{That's much better.}
# {104}{}{Almost got it.}
# {105}{}{This is going to take a while.}
# {106}{}{That's the problem!}
# {107}{}{John, I think I isolated the problem.}
# {108}{}{Damn!}
# {109}{}{Darn!}
# {110}{}{My fault!}
# {111}{}{I'm okay.}
# {112}{}{Okay, that hurt.}
# {113}{}{I meant to do that.}
# {114}{}{Why does that keep happening?}
# {115}{}{My eyes!}
# {116}{}{You're not a knight.}
# {117}{}{I need to talk to a knight.}
# {118}{}{I don't understand, the power cells keep shorting out.}
# {119}{}{You should stand back these can be dangerous.}
# {120}{}{Please don't distract me.}
# {121}{}{Watch where you're standing.}
# {122}{}{You lost?}
# {123}{}{Sorry, I can't talk right now.}
{100}{}{这里全弄错了。}
{101}{}{搞定。}
{102}{}{击发装置老是堵。}

{104}{}{几乎快成了。}
{105}{}{这要花一会儿。}
{106}{}{问题就在这儿！}
{107}{}{约翰, 我觉得我太孤立地看这个问题了。}
{108}{}{该死！}
{109}{}{该死！}
{110}{}{我的错！}
{111}{}{好了。}
{112}{}{得，这下糟了。}
{113}{}{我本来就是这么想的。}
{114}{}{怎么老出这种事？}
{115}{}{我的眼睛！}
{116}{}{你不是一个骑士。}
{117}{}{我需要和一个骑士说说。}
{118}{}{我不明白。能量电池总是在短路。}
{119}{}{你应该向后站，这些可能是危险的。}
{120}{}{请不要打扰我。}
{121}{}{小心脚下！}
{122}{}{你迷路了？}
{123}{}{抱歉，我现在不能聊天。}
