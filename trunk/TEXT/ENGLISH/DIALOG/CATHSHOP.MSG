#{100}{}{You see a shopkeeper.}
#{101}{}{The Holy Flame does not appreciate thieves and scoundrels in his house of worship.  You will be punished!}
#{102}{}{Hng!}
#{103}{}{I wasn't stealing from you, honest!}
#{104}{}{Why don't you tell the Holy Flame when you see him after your 'punishment.'}
#{105}{}{I care not for your lies, neither shall the Master.}
#{106}{}{I'm sorry the shop is closed.}
#{107}{}{Nugga.}
#{108}{}{Thanks for nothing.}
#{109}{}{Why is that?}
#{110}{}{Don't mention it.}
#{111}{}{The Children do not have to deal with your kind.  And you've been
# causing us a serious problem. I would like you to go away before I
# have to call in reinforcements.}
#{112}{}{You don't have to do that. I'm your friend.}
#{113}{}{Whatever.}
#{114}{}{I refuse to deal with those that use weapons to make demands.  We
# Children have grown beyond the simple use of guns and weapons.}
#{115}{}{Gun control fascist nut!}
#{116}{}{Let me holster it and we can barter in peace.}
#{117}{}{Good, I'd like that. I'd be happy to do business with you.}
#{118}{}{Greetings, my fellow Child.  How can I help you?}
#{119}{}{Lugga!?}
#{120}{}{What do you have to trade?}
#{121}{}{Thanks. See you later, alligator.}
#{122}{}{I'm sorry. Perhaps we can just make a deal.}
#{123}{}{Brye!}
#{124}{}{After a while, crocodile. I can't believe I just said that.}
#{125}{}{Greetings! How can I help you? I do hope that you will take a moment
# to realize the significance of any future decisions you might make in
# regards to your soul...}
#{126}{}{Baarta!}
#{127}{}{What do you have to trade?}
#{128}{}{Where can I get one of those fancy robes of yours...}
#{129}{}{Only trusted members of the Cathedral are allowed to wear the holy purple.}
#{130}{}{I guess that answers my question, thanks!}
#{131}{}{Stuck up fool. I guess I will have to take yours!}
#{132}{}{Oh, well. What do you have to trade?}
#{133}{}{Oh, stuff to pander to the rubes who walk in the door.  Nothing too special.
# Go ahead, take a look.}
#{134}{}{Thanks, see you later.}
#{135}{}{We have all sorts of special items to remember your trip to the Cathedral.
# These memories can't be bought cheaply, you understand.}
#{136}{}{Thanks...}
#{137}{}{You're welcome. Have pleasant days for the rest of your life.}

{100}{}{你看见一位店主。}
{101}{}{神圣的火焰不会纵容在他的殿堂之中存在小偷和恶棍。你会受到惩罚的！}
{102}{}{哼！}
{103}{}{我没偷东西，真的！}
{104}{}{在你的“惩罚”之后上西天见你的狗屁圣火吧！}
{105}{}{我不会相信你的谎言的，教主也不会。}
{106}{}{对不起，店铺打烊了。}
{107}{}{啊，啥？}
{108}{}{没事，多谢。}
{109}{}{为什么？}
{110}{}{不客气。}
{111}{}{我们教徒不想和你这样的人打交道，你给我们造成了很大的麻烦，你赶紧走开，要不我就喊人了。}
{112}{}{别啊，我是你的朋友。}
{113}{}{那就算了。}
{114}{}{我拒绝和那些用枪说话的人做买卖。我们教徒不会用简单的枪炮来做事。}
{115}{}{枪支管理？你们是纳粹猪啊！}
{116}{}{那我就收起来，我们和平的买卖。}
{117}{}{好，这样才好，那我很乐意和你交易。}
{118}{}{你好教友，我能帮你什么？}
{119}{}{甚么？！}
{120}{}{你都卖些什么？}
{121}{}{谢谢。再见，鳄鱼。}
{122}{}{对不起，也许我们能做个买卖。}
{123}{}{再见！}
{124}{}{等一下，鳄鱼，我没意识到刚才我说的话。}
{125}{}{你好！你需要什么？我真的希望你好好考虑一下你未来的行为对你的灵魂可能造成的影响……}
{126}{}{我要买卖！}
{127}{}{你卖些什么？}
{128}{}{我怎么样才能得到和你们一样的袍子？}
{129}{}{只有最值得信任的大教堂教徒才能穿上神圣的紫袍。}
{130}{}{明白了，多谢！}
{131}{}{别动！我要你的这件袍子！}
{132}{}{哦，那么，你都卖什么东西？}
{133}{}{也就是些忽悠乡巴佬的平常货。没什么特别的，你来看看吧。}
{134}{}{多谢，再见。}
{135}{}{我还有各种有关教堂的纪念品，这些可不便宜，明白？}
{136}{}{谢了……}
{137}{}{不客气，祝愿您一生幸福！}
