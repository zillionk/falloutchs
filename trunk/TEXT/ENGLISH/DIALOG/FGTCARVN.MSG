{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see the Fargo Traders Caravan Driver.}
#{101}{}{Hi, if you're wantin' a job on a caravan, you should talk to Rutger.  He's just over there.}
#{102}{}{You're gonna need to talk to Rutger.}
#{103}{}{So you signed up.  Good to hear it.  So ya know, we leave just about every ten days. That's the 8th, 18th, and 28th of each month.  Right now we're making runs to The Brotherhood, Junktown and the LA Boneyard.}
#{104}{}{So what's the pay?}
#{105}{}{Um.}
#{106}{}{You'll get 400 hubbucks. You might be sayin' that it ain't that much, but we go out often and you ain't gonna lose your life that easy.  But you get that pay going each way, not that you have to go each way, but you'll get a total of 800 if you do. }
#{107}{}{ We're headin' out today.  You interested?}
#{108}{}{ We take off on }
#{109}{}{Empty}
#{110}{}{}
#{111}{}{. You interested?}
#{112}{}{I'll still give you a job, even though... never mind.  Are you interested?}
#{113}{}{Sure. }
#{114}{}{No.}
#{115}{}{Maybe.}
#{116}{}{Yaya.}
#{117}{}{Tae?}
#{118}{}{Alrighty.  Not a problem.  Just let me know if you change your mind.}
#{119}{}{Would you just make up your mind?}
#{120}{}{Come back by if you end up looking for something to do.  That's the 8st, 18th, and 28th. Bye.}
#{121}{}{Uh, it ain't gonna work if you can't tell your right foot from your left.  Sorry big guy.}
#{122}{}{Head on back when your feeling better.}
#{123}{}{Man, you don't seem to be doing well.   You should get something in your stomach, just stay clar of Bob's.}
#{124}{}{Get on out of here!}
#{125}{}{Couldn't just leave my stuff alone, could you?  Why did you do it?}
#{126}{}{Cuz I'm a mean green moth'a from outer space, and I'm... 'bad'!}
#{127}{}{I didn't want to, but I'm starving and I have kids to feed.}
#{128}{}{I'll carve your heart out with a spoon! }
#{129}{}{(Surrender)}
#{130}{}{(Attack)}
#{131}{}{So you just spit in my face huh?  I guess the only way to get this through your thick skull, is to remove it from that neck of yours.}
#{132}{}{Fine, but that don't make it right.  You still are gonna have to get out of here.}
#{133}{}{You think I'd believe that crap?  Guards!}
#{134}{}{Maybe putting you in the tank will give you a better set of manners.  Are you gonna come quietly, or are we going to have to do this the hard way?}
#{135}{}{I'll see you in hell!}
#{136}{}{Yes.  I'm sorry.}
#{137}{}{So you're a tough guy, huh?  Just lookin' for another fight?}
#{138}{}{If you don't get out of here, I'm gonna call the cops!}
#{139}{}{Guards! Police!}
#{140}{}{I think you should leave..}
#{141}{}{Sorry, but I ain't gonna offer you a job.}
#{142}{}{I'd love to give you a job, but it's just not gonna happen.}
#{143}{}{Leave.}
#{144}{}{Pretty cute, but I'm not really into your kind.}
#{145}{}{Well OK then! It'll pay 400 hubbucks. Which route would you prefer?}
#{146}{}{Great to hear.  Come back by on }
#{147}{}{8th}
#{148}{}{18th}
#{149}{}{28th}
#{150}{}{}
#{151}{}{}
#{152}{}{Brotherhood of Steel }
#{153}{}{.  You'll be headin' out then.  Like always it'll pay 400 hubbucks.}
#{154}{}{Okay.}
#{155}{}{Sorry, can't wait.}
#{156}{}{Not sure what happened, but the whole caravan was lost.  Funny thing for something like that to happen, and for you to be the only one left standing?  Things don't generally fall that way.  I just don't think I can hire you anymore because of it.  I'm sure you understand why.}
#{157}{}{Junktown}
#{158}{}{LA Boneyard }
#{159}{}{Um, not right now. Maybe another time.}
#{160}{}{Good to hear, I'll round up the rest of the crew.}
#{161}{}{Great.}
#{162}{}{Get on out of here.  Good luck!}
#{163}{}{Try to avoid trouble, don't go lookin' for it.}
#{164}{}{You be careful out there, the Boneyard ain't the safest of places..}
#{165}{}{That's good. Those black walkways are really strange, but they're great to travel on.}
#{166}{}{They definitely got a bad element out that way.  I'd watch who you deal with while down that way.}
#{167}{}{Great.  Junktown ain't a bad place.}
#{168}{}{Oh, and stop on by Killain, and tell him 'Hi" for me.  Man, the times we used to have on the caravans.}
#{169}{}{Hear some odd doctor is out that way.  Deals in the dead, so they say.}
#{170}{}{What in the hell were you thinkin leaving that caravan.  It came back safe, but that was pure damn luck.}
#{171}{}{Can I have another chance?}
#{172}{}{Nothing.}
#{173}{}{I don't give a crap!}
#{174}{}{Ig wa neeka rooola?}
#{175}{}{Lig.}
#{176}{}{You screwed it up again.  You just can't seem to handle this line of work.}
#{177}{}{Why should I?}
#{178}{}{You shouldn't.}
#{179}{}{Because I'm going to put a hole through your head if you don't.}
#{180}{}{I had better things to do than hang around some dumb caravan.}
#{181}{}{I didn't know I wasn't allowed to leave. Everything seemed okay.}
#{182}{}{I see... you where on drugs.  Well, live that life if you wish it.}
#{183}{}{I'm sorry you feel that way.}
#{184}{}{Surprisin' that you ain't done this before.  Since that's the case, it ain't gonna harm anyone if I give you another chance.}
#{185}{}{You did a good piece of work.  You want to sign up for another?}
#{186}{}{Sure.}
#{187}{}{No.}
#{188}{}{Maybe.}
#{189}{}{Eeek!}
#{190}{}{Lub.}
#{191}{}{Got all you're gear?  We're going out today.}
#{192}{}{Yes.}
#{193}{}{No!}
#{194}{}{Ack!}
#{195}{}{Otherwise I'll just give it to someone else, don't worry about it. You're not obligated... until you leave with the caravan, right?}
#{196}{}{Next caravan ain't runnin' until }
#{197}{}{8th}
#{198}{}{18th}
#{199}{}{28th}
#{200}{}{}
#{201}{}{}
#{202}{}{}
#{203}{}{. Head on back here if you still want the job. }

#{216}{}{Brotherhood of Steel, here we come! Well?I'm not going with you, but you know what I mean.}
#{217}{}{Okay, get out of my face already.  Those Brotherhood fanatics are waiting for you.}
#{218}{}{I hope you like mountains!  You're going right into them.  You should see lots of action there.}
#{219}{}{Ready to go, and you'll be heading straight though the mountains!  It should be a blast!}
{100}{}{你看到一个远行商会的车夫。}
{101}{}{嗨，如果你想找工作就去找罗格尔。他正好就在那边。}
{102}{}{你有什么需要就去找罗格尔。}
{103}{}{你被录用了。听好了，你要知道，我们每隔10天离开一次。也就是每个月的8日、18日，和28日。现在我们要动身去钢铁兄弟会，迦克镇，还有洛杉矶的晒骨场。}
{104}{}{那么报酬是什么？}
{105}{}{嗯。}
{106}{}{你将得到400个瓶盖。你或许会说那不是很多，但是，我们很有办这差事的经验，所以你不会那么容易挂掉。还有，你可以自己选择走哪条路线。交差后你一共会得800个瓶盖。}
{107}{}{ 我们今天要赶路。你有兴趣同去吗？}
{108}{}{我们出发}
{109}{}{空的}
{110}{}{}
{111}{}{。你感兴趣吗？}
{112}{}{我这一直都有活做，甚至……没关系。你感兴趣吗？}
{113}{}{当然。}
{114}{}{不。}
{115}{}{也许吧。}
{116}{}{耶耶。}
{117}{}{恩？}
{118}{}{好吧。没问题。如果你改变主意了就再来找我吧。}
{119}{}{你有什么意见要补充吗？}
{120}{}{如果你想找活干的话就回来。记住8日、18日和28日。再见。}
{121}{}{啊，对不起朋友。如果你要是一窍不通的门外汉的话。就不能给你工作。}
{122}{}{回去的时候你感觉好多了。}
{123}{}{伙计，你看起来气色不太好。你该吃点东西。不过不要去鲍勃家。}
{124}{}{离远点！}
{125}{}{离我的货远点！行不行啊？你他妈的干吗呢？}
{126}{}{呵呵，我是来自外太空的绿色飞蛾，而且我很……坏！}
{127}{}{不要啊，我好饿，我还有个孩子要抚养咧。}
{128}{}{我要用勺把你丫蛋挖出来！}
{129}{}{【求饶】}
{130}{}{【攻击】}
{131}{}{你把口水喷我一脸？我要把你的脑袋塞你脖子里！}
{132}{}{很好，但是别那么做。你应该安静的离开这里。}
{133}{}{你认为我会相信你那些废话？卫兵！}
{134}{}{也许把你塞到坦克里是对你的一种礼貌。你能安静些吗？或者去避难所找点事情做？}
{135}{}{我要看着你下地狱！}
{136}{}{是的，很抱歉。}
{137}{}{你牛逼啊？找茬打架啊？}
{138}{}{如果你再不离开这，我可就要喊警察了！}
{139}{}{卫兵！警察！来人呐！}
{140}{}{我认为你应该离开……}
{141}{}{抱歉，我不建议你工作。}
{142}{}{我很想给你工作，可是不太凑巧。}
{143}{}{离开。}
{144}{}{又聪明又漂亮，可我不接受你。}
{145}{}{非常好！这是给你的400个瓶盖。你还打算走哪一条路线？}
{146}{}{好消息。回来了。}

{152}{}{钢铁兄弟会}
{153}{}{。找你带队，和往常一样付400个瓶盖。}
{154}{}{好的。}
{155}{}{抱歉，不能等。}
{156}{}{真想不到，整个商队都能迷路。可笑的是这类事情还不止发生过一次，你能忍受吗？真不是一般的不顺，我可不想我雇佣了你之后也像他们一样，我很确定你认路。}
{157}{}{迦克镇}
{158}{}{洛杉矶-晒骨场}
{159}{}{恩，现在不行。下回把。}
{160}{}{听好了，我们所有成员要凑齐一起休息。}
{161}{}{好主意。}
{162}{}{走吧。好运！}
{163}{}{别找麻烦，不要过去看它。}
{164}{}{多留点心眼，晒骨场可不是个安全的地方……}
{165}{}{不错。那些路线虽然陌生，但却是个伟大的行程。}
{166}{}{他们在上路的时候，肯定拿了个坏元件。沿路走走，我想看看你是怎么交易的。}
{167}{}{不错。迦克镇是个好地方。}
{168}{}{在镇长基利安那停一下，帮我向他问个好。伙计，我和他在商队一起干过。}
{169}{}{听说一些老医生已经解决了那问题。在死亡中处理的，所以他们那么说。}
{170}{}{你他妈的到底在想什么呢，居然离开那个商队。它是相当安全的, 只是运气不大好而以。}
{171}{}{能再给我一次机会吗？}
{172}{}{没了。}
{173}{}{我不多废话了！}
{174}{}{啊呜……嗯哦……？}
{175}{}{打嗝……}
{176}{}{你又喝多了，你似乎干不了这行。}
{177}{}{为什么是我？}
{178}{}{你不该这样。}
{179}{}{如果你不，我就把你抽成面瘫。}
{180}{}{我还是把事做了，那比在商队闲逛好。}
{181}{}{我不管，我不允许请假。任何事情都不行。}
{182}{}{我看看……你的毒品在那？很好，如果你不想死。}
{183}{}{抱歉你谨慎点。}
{184}{}{真令人惊讶，在此之前你没完成。好把，如果我再给你一次机会的话，你不能伤害任何人。}
{185}{}{着份工作你干的不错。你还想在签另一份吗？}
{186}{}{当然。}
{187}{}{不了。}
{188}{}{也许吧。}
{189}{}{耶～耶～}
{190}{}{乜。}
{191}{}{不拿着你所有的装备吗？今天我们就出发！}
{192}{}{是的！}
{193}{}{不！}
{194}{}{中！}
{195}{}{否则我将给另外的人了, 别为这个烦恼。直到你离开商队为止，你都不需要负责……如何？}
{196}{}{直到下次商队不在运营为止}
{197}{}{八日}
