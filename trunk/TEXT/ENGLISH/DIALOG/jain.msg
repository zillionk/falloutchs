#{101}{JAIN00}{Why do you disturb an elder of the Cathedral?}
{101}{JAIN00}{你为什么要来打扰一位大教堂高级牧师？}

#{102}{}{I have come seeking a blessing.}
{102}{}{我是来乞求祝福的。}

#{103}{}{I'm interested in your church, and I want some information. Do you have any pamphlets?}
{103}{}{我对你们大教堂很感兴趣，我想打听些消息。你们有宣传手册吗？}

#{104}{}{Just looking around.}

#{108}{}{Poopie!}

#{109}{JAIN02}{How dare you speak to me in that manner! You will be punished for your insolence! Guards!}
{109}{JAIN02}{你怎么能这样和我说话！你会因为你的无礼而被惩罚的，卫兵！}

#{110}{JAIN03}{Perhaps one of our priests will discuss your needed education. Leave now.}
{110}{JAIN03}{也许我们的低级牧师可以教教你基本的识字说话，你走吧。}

#{112}{}{Yes.}
{112}{}{是的。}

#{113}{}{No.}
{113}{}{没有。}

#{114}{JAIN05}{Then you would have known high elders of the Cathedral do not just 'hand out' blessings. You will leave now.}
{114}{JAIN05}{那你就应该明白高级牧师不只是干“施与”祝福的工作，你可以走了。}

#{115}{JAIN07}{Continue to mock me and I will have you thrown out.}

#{117}{}{Mock you? Now why would I do something like that?!}

{121}{JAIN09}{从你的言辞中看不到一点悔改的意思，只有异端邪说，你会被净化的，然后永远地被人遗忘。}

#{129}{}{I am a devout believer.}

#{130}{JAIN12}{Then you should know better then to be here. I would caution you about your manners. Leave.}
{130}{JAIN12}{那你就应该去参研经文，而不是在这里，要注意你的礼节，走吧。}

#{131}{}{OK.}
{131}{}{好。}

#{132}{}{Bite me.}
{132}{}{扯你娘的蛋。}

#{133}{JAIN13}{Are you interested in converting to our faith? We can offer you what no one else can...}
{133}{JAIN13}{你有兴趣改信我们的教义么？我可以给你其他人都不能给你的好处．．．}

#{134}{}{And what's that?}
{134}{}{是什么？}

#{135}{}{No, not interested. I think you're a bunch of kooks.}
{135}{}{不干，没兴趣，你们就是一帮疯子。}

#{136}{JAIN14}{A lifetime of contentment. Fulfillment in the knowledge you're working to rebuild the planet and make a better place for those that follow.}
{136}{JAIN14}{一辈子的幸福。充实你的知识，努力“实现”星球的重建和信徒的美好未来。}

#{137}{}{Sounds very interesting, could you tell me more? I seek fulfillment.}
{137}{}{听起来不错，你能说的仔细一点么？我想“实现”这些梦想。}

#{138}{}{Oh yeah, I bet there's a lot of rebuilding going on and I'm sure your cups are overflowing with fulfillment.}
{138}{}{好哇，我敢打赌到处都是造人计划，你的奶罩里会充实各种“实现”的。}

#{139}{}{I don't think so. Sounds a little fishy to me.}
{139}{}{不干，这里面有蹊跷。}

#{140}{JAIN15}{Believe what you will. Just do it elsewhere. You may leave.}
{140}{JAIN15}{随你怎么想，但别在这里胡言乱语，你可以走了。}

#{141}{JAIN17}{Mocking our holy cause is not appreciated. You will be punished if you continue.}
{141}{JAIN17}{讽刺我们崇高的事业是可耻的。你再这样就会被严惩！}

#{142}{}{And who's going to do the punishing? Ooh, I'd like to request the extra hard whip, if you don't mind.}
{142}{}{谁来主罚啊？我提议加一条带劲的好鞭子，如果你喜欢的话。}

#{143}{}{Sorry.}
{143}{}{对不起。}

#{144}{JAIN18}{When the Children walk the reborn land, your kind will vanish, heretic. Leave now.}
{144}{JAIN18}{当我们大教堂的孩子们在重生之地兴盛时，便是汝等杂碎消亡的时候，走开！}

#{145}{JAIN19}{I am not completely devoid of humor, but leading the Children is something I take seriously. Please remember that.}

#{150}{}{How can Children find peace in this wasteland?}
