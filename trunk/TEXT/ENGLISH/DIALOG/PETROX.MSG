#{100}{}{You see Petrox, a desert bandit.}
#{101}{}{Greetings! I am Petrox. I am one of Garl's lead raiders. Who are you?}
#{102}{}{I'm }
#{103}{}{. What do you do as a raider?}
#{104}{}{My name is unimportant at the moment. Can you tell me something about your #camp?}
#{105}{}{Hroo?}
#{106}{}{As a raider, I get to travel to many parts of the wasteland. In my
# travels, I get supplies for the camp.}
#{107}{}{In other words, you steal from the people you go to.}
#{108}{}{Hey, that's really great of you. I'm sure that Garl is pleased with you.}
#{109}{}{What places have you been to?}
#{110}{}{Well, it's nice that you think that you are so important that you don't need #a
# name to go around here. But, I will at least tell you a little about us. We
# are the toughest people in the wastelands. No one can stand against us. Not
# even those wimps from Shady Sands or Junktown.}
#{111}{}{What about Shady Sands?}
#{112}{}{What is Junktown?}
#{113}{}{I am sorry, but I don't have time to waste on those who are slow. Good bye.}
#{114}{}{We never steal. We just take the extra that others have and redistribute #it
# among our hungry people.}
#{115}{}{So, basically, you steal it.}
#{116}{}{That sounds like a really great idea.}
#{117}{}{I've been to many places in the wastelands. The closest places that I've
# been to are Shady Sands and Junktown. Not much happens in those places, but
# they are always full of information and supplies.}
#{118}{}{Tell me about Shady Sands.}
#{119}{}{Tell me about Junktown.}
#{120}{}{You are starting to become annoying now. I think I will
# end that slight problem.}
#{121}{}{Shady Sands is a fertile community. They are happy to, um,
# share their bounty with us.}
#{122}{}{What can you tell me about Junktown?}
#{123}{}{Junktown is a little bit south of here. They have many good women.}
#{124}{}{Junktown is a little bit south of here. They have many good women.
# Say . . . I can show you around sometime, maybe we can
# get to know each other better . . . whaddya say?}
#{125}{}{No thanks, maybe some other time.}
#{126}{}{Sure, maybe later.}
#{127}{}{Well, maybe later.}
#{128}{}{I have told you all that I am permitted. Please go.}

{100}{}{你看到派特拉克斯，一个沙漠盗匪。}
{101}{}{日安。我是派特拉克斯，是伽尔匪帮的首领之一。你是谁？}
{102}{}{我是}
{103}{}{。你当歹徒都做些什么？}
{104}{}{我的名字不重要。你能给我介绍一下你的营地吗？}
{105}{}{哦？}
{106}{}{作为一个大盗贼，我得在这废土上跑东跑西，为我的营地弄到一些补给。}
{107}{}{换句说，你走到哪偷到哪。}
{108}{}{哈，你真是厉害。我们老大伽尔肯定喜欢你。}
{109}{}{你都去过哪些地方？}
{110}{}{你行啊你。你觉得在这附近晃荡不用报名字的。关于我们，可以告诉你的是：我们是这废土上最拉风的家伙。没人敢跟我们作对。沙荫镇或者迦克镇的鸟人也不敢。}
{111}{}{沙荫镇？}
{112}{}{迦克镇？}
{113}{}{很抱歉。我可没时间浪费在下等人身上。再见。}
{114}{}{我们可从来不偷，我们只是把别人多余的东西拿来给分给我们这里这些更贫困的人，也算回收利用了。}
{115}{}{不好意思，你们还是偷东西。}
{116}{}{这想法似乎挺好。}
{117}{}{我去过太多地方了。最近的地方有沙荫镇和迦克镇。都是些无聊的地方，不过总是可以从那得到很多补给和消息。}
{118}{}{跟我说说沙荫镇。}
{119}{}{跟我说说迦克镇。}
{120}{}{你开始惹人厌了。我想我会解决这个小问题的。}
{121}{}{沙荫镇是个富足的小地方。我他们很乐意……恩……跟我们分享他们的收成。}
{122}{}{关于迦克镇能告诉我点什么吗？}
{123}{}{迦克镇在南边。那的女人物美价廉，货源充足。}
{124}{}{迦克镇在南边。那的女人物美价廉，货源充足。我说，我倒是可以带你到处看看，或许我们能更了解对方。怎么样？}
{125}{}{不，谢了。以后再说吧。}
{126}{}{当然，过段时间吧。}
{127}{}{好，过段时间吧。}
{128}{}{能说的我都说了。请走吧。}
