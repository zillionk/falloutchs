#{100}{}{You see Laura.}
{100}{}{你看到劳拉。}

#{102}{laura0m}{Hello, my brother. May I be of service this glorious day?}
{102}{laura0m}{嗨，我的兄弟。在这美好的一天里需要我的服务吗？}

#{104}{laura0f}{Hello, my sister. May I be of service this glorious day?}
{104}{laura0f}{嗨，我的姐妹。在这美好的一天里需要我的服务吗？}

#{105}{}{Are you Laura?}
{105}{}{你是劳拉吗？}

#{106}{}{Can I ask you a few questions about the Children?}
{106}{}{我能问你一点关于教徒的问题吗？}

#{107}{}{What kind of "services" do you offer?}
{107}{}{你能提供什么样的“服务”？}

#{108}{}{Mom?}
{108}{}{妈妈？}

#{110}{laura01a}{That's very sweet of you, but no, I'm not.
# I'm sure you can find her somewhere else.}
{110}{laura01a}{你真的很可爱，但我不是你的妈妈哦。我相信你一定能在别的地方找到她。}

#{112}{laura2}{I most certainly am.  Did you want something?}
{112}{laura2}{我就是劳拉。你需要什么吗？}

#{113}{}{Nicole sent me to talk to you.}
{113}{}{妮可尔让我来找你。}

#{114}{}{Uh . . . no. Never mind.}
{114}{}{啊……不。没关系。}

#{116}{laura3}{Nicole? I'm so sorry. I don't believe I know anyone by that name.}
{116}{laura3}{妮可尔？很抱歉。我想我不认识有人叫这个名字。}

#{117}{}{Well, she told me to tell you 'Red Rider'.}
{117}{}{哦，她让我对你说“红骑士”。}

#{118}{}{Sure you do! She sent me!}
{118}{}{你当然认识！她派我过来的！}

#{120}{laura4}{I'm sorry. I . . . I just don't know.
# Follow me to a place where we can talk.}
{120}{laura4}{对不起。我……我真的不知道。跟我到个咱们能说话的地方去。}

#{122}{laura9}{I'm terribly sorry for your inconvenience. I hope it doesn't upset you.}
{122}{laura9}{我很抱歉给你惹了麻烦。希望你别生气。}

#{124}{laura10}{Are you . . . certain? Uh . . . excuse my curiosity,
# but you seemed to be looking specifically for me.}
{124}{laura10}{你……确定么？啊……请别介意我的好奇，但是你好像就是在找我。}

#{125}{}{Well, Nicole sent me.}
{125}{}{喔，妮可尔派我来的。}

#{126}{}{Just heard about you and wanted to see what you looked like.}
{126}{}{只是听说过你，想来看看你长得什么模样。}

#{128}{laura11}{I . . . I'm sorry, but that sort of attention
# makes me a little nervous. Don't know why,
# it's silly of me, I know. Well, enjoy your walk.}
{128}{laura11}{我……对不起，这种关心有点让我紧张。不知道为什么，我真傻，我知道。哎，你走好。}

#{130}{laura14}{Oh, I'm hardly an authority. You should see Morpheus,
# the High Priest. I'm sure he can help you much more than I.}
{130}{laura14}{啊，我还算不上是权威。你应该去找神父墨菲斯。我确定他能比我帮你更多。}

#{132}{laura15}{But I only meant . . . oh . . . I have to go now.}
{132}{laura15}{可我的意思是……呃……我要走了。}

#{134}{laura16g}{Well, hello again! Are you just walking or may I help?}
{134}{laura16g}{啊，你好！你是随便逛逛还是需要我的帮忙呢？}

#{136}{laura16b}{Is there . . . something I can help you with?}
{136}{laura16b}{有什么我可以帮你的么？}

#{137}{}{Are you Laura?}
{137}{}{你是劳拉么？}

#{138}{}{Can I ask you a few questions about the Children?}
{138}{}{我能问你一点关于教徒的问题么？}

#{139}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
{139}{}{没事，谢谢。}

#{140}{}{Uh, Mom?}
{140}{}{啊，妈妈？}

#{142}{laura16a}{No. We already talked about this. You'll have to go
# somewhere else my friend.}
{142}{laura16a}{不。我们已经谈论过这个了。你应该到别的地方去，我的朋友。}

#{144}{laura21}{Oh . . . I'm glad you found me. Nicole sent a list with the
# information I was supposed to find.}
{144}{laura21}{噢……很高兴你找到了我。妮可尔给了我一个列表，要我调查上面的信息。}

#{145}{}{So what did you get?}
{145}{}{那你找到什么了？}

#{147}{laura22}{Um.  There's so much I'm just . . . I'm not sure what
# you need or where to start. Is there
# something in particular you want to know about?}
{147}{laura22}{嗯。有太多的……我不知道你需要什么或从哪开始。你具体想知道什么呢？}

#{148}{}{Is there a secret entrance into the Inner Sanctum of the Church?}
{148}{}{有没有暗道通向教堂的密室？}

#{149}{}{What have you learned about The Master?}
{149}{}{你调查到主教的什么了？}

#{150}{}{What are the Children's plans?}
{150}{}{教徒们的计划是？}

#{151}{}{What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?}
{151}{}{象你这么漂亮的女孩在这样的地方做什么呢？}

#{152}{}{Nothing more, thanks.}
{152}{}{没别的了。谢谢。}

#{154}{laura24}{It's not the Inner Sanctum you want to enter.}
{154}{laura24}{你想要进去的不是密室。}

#{155}{}{Then what?}
{155}{}{那是什么？}

#{157}{laura25}{I followed Morpheus down a back secret staircase.
# The guy activates a secret door at the bottom.}
{157}{laura25}{我跟踪了墨菲斯到了一个秘密的楼梯，那家伙用按钮启动了一个密门。}

#{158}{}{Then what?}
{158}{}{然后呢？}

#{159}{}{Can you show me this door?}
{159}{}{ 你能给我看看那扇门么？}

#{161}{laura26}{He uses this strange key to open it and
# disappears. I've never tried to follow him.}
{161}{laura26}{他用了这把奇怪的钥匙开门然后消失了。然后我就没能继续跟踪。}

#{162}{}{Do you know where this key is?}
{162}{}{你知道这把钥匙在哪里么？}

#{163}{}{Why not?}
{163}{}{为什么不？}

#{165}{laura27}{Well, I'd say he keeps it on him.}
{165}{laura27}{啊，我想他总是随身带着。}

#{166}{}{Will you show me the door now?}
{166}{}{现在告诉我门在哪里吧？}

#{168}{laura28a}{Well, of course.}
{168}{laura28a}{哦，当然。}

#{169}{}{Great. Let's go.}
{169}{}{好极了。我们走。}

#{170}{}{Can I ask you a few more questions first?}
{170}{}{我能先问你点别的问题么？}

#{172}{laura29}{Follow me.}
{172}{laura29}{跟我来。}

#{174}{laura30a}{Okay, but we have to hurry.}
{174}{laura30a}{好的，但我们要抓紧时间了。}

#{176}{laura30b}{Oh, make it quick.}
{176}{laura30b}{噢，快点。}

#{178}{laura31}{Believe me, if you've seen the Nightkin,
# you'd know why. Unless you're stupid.}
{178}{laura31}{相信我，如果你见了“隐形人”你就知道为什么了。除非你是笨蛋。}

#{179}{}{Maybe I am, but I'm not scared.}
{179}{}{也许我是，但我不害怕。}

#{180}{}{I can understand that. Can we get back to the questions?}
{180}{}{我可以理解。我们回到问题上来吧。}

#{182}{laura32}{Oh, I see that's real funny. Lookit, I'm in the
# middle of this day in and day out.
# You have a problem with how I do this,
# you just keep it to yourself. Ya got it?}
{182}{laura32}{啊，我知道这很有趣。听着，我一天到晚冒着危险。你还对我的作为有看法，好自为之吧，你明白了吗？}

#{183}{}{What are you going to do, whine some more?}
{183}{}{你还要做什么，继续诉苦吗？}

#{184}{}{If that's how you want it.}
{184}{}{如果这就是你想要的。}

#{185}{}{You're right, I'm sorry. How about we get back to business?}
{185}{}{你是对的，很抱歉。我们回到正事上来好吗？}

#{187}{laura33}{Uh, not much. The Children worship him, and sometimes
# a huge vision of him appears in the main nave of the church.}
{187}{laura33}{啊，不多。那些教徒崇拜他，有时他的一个巨大影像出现在教堂的中央。}

#{188}{}{So he's real?}
{188}{}{那么他是真的了？}

#{189}{}{Sounds scary.}
{189}{}{听起来很可怕。}

#{191}{laura34}{Yes and no. I snuck up to the front one day
# and found a strange mechanical device with a lens under the altar.}
{191}{laura34}{是也不是。有天我偷偷地发现有一套带有镜片的机械设备在圣坛下面。}

#{192}{}{Probably a holo-projector of some kind.}
{192}{}{可能是某种全息投影机。}

#{193}{}{So?}
{193}{}{那么？}

#{195}{laura35}{Huh . . . believe me, it was at first, but then I
# snuck up and looked at the alter when nobody was
# looking. And there's a device underneath with
# wires and a big lens.}
{195}{laura35}{哈……相信我，这仅仅是开始，然后在没人注意的时候，我偷偷溜到圣坛。那下面有个带着电线和长杆的装置。}

#{196}{}{Probably a holo-projector of some kind.}
{196}{}{可能是某种全息投影机。}

#{197}{}{So?}
{197}{}{那么？}

#{199}{laura36}{So I'm pretty sure this Master is flesh and blood.
# And I also think I know where he is.}
{199}{laura36}{那么我很确定主教是有血肉的。而且我想我也知道他在哪里。}

#{200}{}{Where?}
{200}{}{在哪？}

#{202}{laura37}{Every once in a while, Morpheus will go through a
# secret staircase leading below the Church. And he
# enters a secret door with some kind of key. I think
# the Master is down there.}
{202}{laura37}{每次有段时间，墨菲斯都会走过教堂后面的一段秘密楼梯。而且他用某种钥匙进入一扇密门。我想主教就在那下面。}

#{203}{}{Can you show me this staircase right now?}
{203}{}{你现在可以告诉我这段楼梯在哪么？}

#{204}{}{Do you know where this key is?}
{204}{}{你知道钥匙在哪？}

#{206}{laura38}{Now that's scary. Morpheus is preaching that the
# earth should be 'purged of the infidels,' and
# other crap like that. I think they're planning
# to take over everything!}
{206}{laura38}{这才可怕呢。墨菲斯总是布道说要“净化异端”和其它的废话。我想他们计划要毁掉所有东西！}

#{207}{}{Can they do it?}
{207}{}{他们能行吗？}

#{208}{}{What's their first target?}
{208}{}{他们的第一个目标是什么？}

#{210}{laura39}{Now you know, it could be. I mean, they have
# enough members, and the different hospitals
# in the towns are stocked full of weapons and explosives.}
{210}{laura39}{现在你知道了，他们可以。我的意思是，他们有足够的成员，在不同的城里都有医院，还囤积着大量的武器和炸药。}

#{211}{}{We must tell the Followers.}
{211}{}{我们应该通知末世论者。}

#{212}{}{What are you going to do?}
{212}{}{你要做什么？}

#{214}{laura40}{I was planning on it. In fact, after we're done,
# I'm heading over there.}
{214}{laura40}{我正在准备。事实上，咱们没事了我就过去。}

#{215}{}{One quick question?}
{215}{}{一个小问题？}

#{216}{}{I'll let you go then.}
{216}{}{那你快去吧。}

#{218}{laura41}{Okay. Good luck!}
{218}{laura41}{好的。好运！}

#{220}{laura42}{Well, I'm going to go warn Nicole.
# And hopefully, the Followers can send help to the other towns.}
{220}{laura42}{啊，我要去通知妮可尔。希望末世论者可以帮助其它的镇子。}

#{221}{}{I'd like to ask a few more questions first.}
{221}{}{我想先问些别的问题。}

#{222}{}{Okay, I'll let you go then.}
{222}{}{好的。你去吧。}

#{224}{laura43}{Adytum, that town doesn't have a chance in hell.}
{224}{laura43}{内城区，那个镇子在地狱中没有机会的。}

#{225}{}{What about the Followers?}
{225}{}{末世论者怎么样？}

#{226}{}{Can I help Adytum?}
{226}{}{我能帮助内城区么？}

#{228}{laura44}{The Children don't think we're enough of a threat.
# We'll show 'em.}
{228}{laura44}{教徒们不认为我们有足够的威胁。我们会让他们知道的。}

#{229}{}{Good. What do you plan to do?}
{229}{}{好。你计划做什么？}

#{230}{}{Can I help Adytum in any way?}
{230}{}{我能帮内城区任何忙吗？}

#{232}{laura45}{Yeah, you can help 'em by getting to the Master. 'Bite the
# head off the snake and it won't coil around you,' as my grandmother used
# to say. She was kind of a handful.}
{232}{laura45}{耶，你可以帮他们对付主教。我祖母常说：“打蛇打七寸”，她很有见地哦。}

#{233}{}{How do I get to him?}
{233}{}{我该怎么接近他？}

#{234}{}{Sound it. I need some more answers before you go.}
{234}{}{听起来是。在你走前我有些别的问题。}

#{235}{}{I'm on my way.}
{235}{}{我要开始了。}

#{237}{laura46}{They plan to take over all the towns!}
{237}{laura46}{他们计划控制所有城镇！}

#{238}{}{Which ones?}
{238}{}{哪一个？}

#{240}{laura47}{Adytum's already fallen. The Hub is next.}
{240}{laura47}{内城区已经沦陷了。哈勃城是下一个。}

#{241}{}{What're the Followers doing during this?}
{241}{}{那时候末世论者在做什么？}

#{242}{}{Damn. What can I do?}
{242}{}{可恶。我能做什么？}

#{244}{laura48}{We sent a group to help Adytum,
# and they were all wiped out. Nicole sent another
# one to the Hub. I just hope they get there in time.}
{244}{laura48}{我们派出了一个组织去帮助内城区，他们已经精疲力竭了。妮可尔派出了另一队去哈勃城了，我只希望他们能及时到达。}

#{245}{}{Damn. What can I do?}
{245}{}{该死。我能做什么？}

#{247}{laura49}{They've already taken out the Hub and Adytum!
# I think the Followers are next, so we're preparing our defense.}
{247}{laura49}{他们已经拿下了哈勃城和内城区！我想末世论者就是下一个，所以我们在准备防御。}

#{248}{}{Why are you here then?}
{248}{}{你为什么还在这？}

#{249}{}{What can I do?}
{249}{}{我能做什么？}

#{251}{laura50}{I'm here to keep an eye on the Children.}
{251}{laura50}{我在这里监视着教徒们。}

#{252}{}{What can I do?}
{252}{}{我能做什么？}

#{254}{laura51}{The Children are setting up hospitals all over the place.
# Hmpf. I think they're trying to get people to trust them.}
{254}{laura51}{教徒们在所有的地方建起了医院。哼。我想他们想获得人们的信任。}

#{255}{}{Is it working?}
{255}{}{这管用吗？}

#{256}{}{Is there anyway to stop them?}
{256}{}{有什么办法阻止他们？}

#{257}{}{That's the stupidest thing I ever heard!}
{257}{}{这是我听说过的最蠢的事！}

#{259}{laura52}{Ah, it sure looks that way. I mean, people are flocking to their
# Church. Can't they see it's a fake?}
{259}{laura52}{啊，看上去确实管用。我的意思是，人们涌向他们的教堂。他们看不出这是骗局吗？}

#{260}{}{You sure it is?}
{260}{}{你确定是这样？}

#{261}{}{How can I stop them?}
{261}{}{我该怎么阻止他们？}

#{263}{laura53}{For one thing, people seem to disappear a lot
# around here, while the number of Nightkin are slowly growing.}
{263}{laura53}{首先，附近的人失踪了很多。同时“隐形人”的数量在大大增加。}

#{264}{}{Why?}
{264}{}{为什么？}

#{265}{}{Doesn't look good. But I need more answers before I act.}
{265}{}{看起来不妙。但在行动之前我需要更多的答案。}

#{267}{laura54}{I don't know. That's what you're here to find out, right?}
{267}{laura54}{我不知道。这就是你在这里要调查的，是吗？}

#{269}{laura55}{Find the Master and stop him!}
{269}{laura55}{找到主教，阻止他！}

#{270}{}{What have you found out about this Master?}
{270}{}{关于主教，你知道些什么？}

#{271}{}{I will.}
{271}{}{我会的。}

#{273}{laura56}{Huh, I sure as hell hope so. Now, any more questions? }
{273}{laura56}{哈啊，我非常希望这样。现在还有问题么？}

#{275}{laura57}{Actually, it's a good way to manipulate people,
# and this Master is damn good at it.}
{275}{laura57}{实际上，这是个操控人心的好办法，而且这个该死的主教很擅长。}

#{276}{}{No, I meant that's the stupidest thing I've heard from you.
# You're paranoid, aren't you?}
{276}{}{不，我的意思是这是我从你嘴里听到的最愚蠢的话。你是个妄想狂,不是吗？}

#{277}{}{Well, I'll stop him.}
{277}{}{好，我去阻止他。}

#{278}{}{How can I stop this?}
{278}{}{我该怎么阻止这个？}

#{280}{laura58}{Excuse me?}
{280}{laura58}{你说什么？}

#{281}{}{You heard me.}
{281}{}{你听到了啊。}

#{282}{}{Never mind.}
{282}{}{没事}

#{284}{laura59}{Okay then. Good luck!}
{284}{laura59}{那好吧。你好运！}

#{286}{laura60}{Uh heh . . . Waiting desperately for someone to
# use that pathetic line on me.}
{286}{laura60}{哦呵呵……绝望的等着某人向我说出那个可悲的暗号。}

#{288}{laura61a}{So, what can I do for you now?}
{288}{laura61a}{那么，现在我能为你做什么？}

#{290}{laura61b}{Oh, what now?}
{290}{laura61b}{噢，现在呢？}

#{291}{}{I need to ask you a few more questions.}
{291}{}{我需要问你些别的问题。}

#{292}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
{292}{}{没事。谢谢了。}

#{294}{laura62}{What are you doing? Put that down!}
{294}{laura62}{你在做什么？把它放下来！}

#{296}{laura63}{Hey! Get out of here!}
{296}{laura63}{嘿！滚出这里！}

#{297}{}{Or else what?}
{297}{}{或者别的什么？}

#{298}{}{Sorry, I'll go now.}
{298}{}{对不起，我要走了。}

#{300}{laura64}{Stop that!}
{300}{laura64}{停下！}

#{302}{laura65}{What . . . what are you doing in here? You need to leave!}
{302}{laura65}{你……你在这里做什么？你快出去！}

#{303}{}{No, you get out!}
{303}{}{不，你滚出去！}

#{304}{}{Okay, I'll go.}
{304}{}{好的，我这就走。}

#{306}{laura67}{Uh . . . I'm not sure about that. Go talk to Nicole.}
{306}{laura67}{啊……我对这不太确定。去和妮可尔谈谈。}

#{308}{laura67a}{I'm not sure about that. Go talk to a High Priest.}
{308}{laura67a}{我对这不太确定。去和主教谈谈。}

#{309}{}{Well, as I said . . .}
{309}{}{哦，就像我说的……}

#{310}{}{I said . . .}
{310}{}{我说……}

#{311}{}{Well, as I said before . . .}
{311}{}{哦，就像我以前说的……}

#{312}{}{As I said before . . .}
{312}{}{就像我以前说的……}

#{313}{}{Well, I'm quite certain I told you this already, but . . .}
{313}{}{哦，我很确定我已经告诉过你了，但是……}

#{314}{}{Okay! I already told you this . . .}
{314}{}{好的！我已经告诉过你了……}

#{315}{}{Ah, once more? Well, I said . . .}
{315}{}{啊，再一次？哦，我说……}

#{316}{}{Again? I already said this . . .}
{316}{}{重复？我已经说过这个了……}

#{317}{}{Oh dear, this is most disturbing. I simply will not say it again.}
{317}{}{噢，亲爱的，这真烦人。我在也不说了。}

#{318}{}{Are you . . . Okay! Okay! Are you deaf?
# Read my lips, I'm not gonna to say this again.}
{318}{}{你……好！好！你聋了是吧？看我的嘴唇，我再也不说这个了。}

#{319}{}{I believe that's quite enough. I'll not say it again.}
{319}{}{我想这已经够了。我再也不说这个了。}

#{320}{}{Not listening, huh?  Too bad, I'm not gonna say it again.}
{320}{}{没有听，是吧？大糟了，我再也不说这个了。}

#{321}{}{Oh, those are dreadful people. I'm not going to talk about them at all!}
{321}{}{噢，他们是讨厌的人。我再也不想说他们的事了！}

#{322}{}{Nicole probably told you about us.
# We're trying to knock some sense into those
# thick-skulled, gun-toting, violence-mongering nitwits
# . . . Oh, present company excepted, of course.}
{322}{}{妮可尔可能已经告诉你关于我们的事了。我们试着把一些理性塞到那些迟钝的、持枪的、暴力的傻子脑袋里面。当然，我们自己除外。}

#{323}{}{Well, I don't know who you're talking about.}
{323}{}{哦，我不知道你在说什么。}

#{324}{}{She leads the Followers. Pretty strong-willed. I trust her.}
{324}{}{她领导着末世论者。相当坚强。我相信她。}

#{325}{}{The others are all so nice! It's wonderful here.
# We belong, we do good work . . .}
{325}{}{其他人都很好！这里很奇妙。我们在这里，我们做好事……}

#{326}{}{Oh, they're like a . . . blight on the world. Most
# are a waste and a few are just plain evil.}
{326}{}{噢，他们像这个世界的枯萎病。大多数是些废物，少数是单纯的邪恶。}

#{327}{}{Adytum, isn't that a town west of here?}
{327}{}{内城区，不是西边的那个城镇吗？}

#{328}{}{Adytum's a bit west from here. And the people there
# . . . well, they're a little paranoid, so don't
# expect a hospitable welcome.}
{328}{}{内城区，在这的西边。而且那里的人……哎，他们有点偏执狂，所以不要指望有热情的欢迎。}

#{329}{}{Oh, he's wonderful. He leads us. You should talk to him!}
{329}{}{哦，他太棒了。他领导着我们。你应该和他谈谈！}

#{330}{}{He preaches peace and enlightenment and all that crap,
# but he's scum. No two ways about it.}
{330}{}{他总鼓吹和平、启迪等等的废话。他是个渣滓，没办法。}

#{331}{}{Oh, I can't begin to describe him. Morpheus leads us.
# He can do justice to your question.}
{331}{}{哦，我不能形容他。墨菲斯领导我们。他能对你的问题作出回答。}

#{332}{}{Ah yes, the Master, he's the god these nuts worship. Personally, I
# don't think he's a god, just somebody into manipulating everyone.}
{332}{}{啊是的，主教，他是这些傻瓜崇拜的神。就我个人来说，我不认为他是个神，只是操控人群的某个人。}
