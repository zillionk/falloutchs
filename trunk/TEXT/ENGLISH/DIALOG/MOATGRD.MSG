# {109}{}{}
# {110}{}{}
# {111}{}{You smell like a brahma but I bet you're not as intelligent.}
# {112}{}{}
# {113}{}{Ahh, very good. Customers are always welcome. Come in but please keep your weapons holstered. Go find Zack, he can set you up with anything you need.}
# {114}{}{}
# {115}{}{I need to speak to your boss.  It is very important.}

{111}{}{你闻上去像双头牛，不过我认为你没它那么聪明。}
{112}{}{}
{113}{}{呵，非常好。顾客总是受欢迎的。进来吧，但是你得把枪收起来。去找赞克，他能满足你的任何需要。}
