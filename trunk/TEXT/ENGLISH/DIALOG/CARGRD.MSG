{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see a Caravan Guard.}
#{101}{}{I can't believe we lost the boss. Do you want to come back with us?
# We can still pay you the 400 scripts.}
#{102}{}{It's a shame we lost the Driver; Rutger won't like that one bit.
# If you want, we can still pay you the same to come back with us to
# the Hub.}
#{103}{}{You coming back with us? I'll drive this thing. The pay'll be the
# same.}
#{104}{}{Well, I don't know about you, but I think I'll wait around for another
# caravan. I don't want to go back alone. If you want to go back I'll go
# with you, but if I don't make it you won't get paid the 400 scripts.}
#{105}{}{That was pretty nasty. If you really want, I can get you another
# 400 scripts if you come back to the Hub with me. It's dangerous for one
# person.}
#{106}{}{You'll get another 400 scripts if you can get me and the caravan
# back safely to the Hub, but only if I make it. You've got to cover
# me if we get in a fight.}
#{107}{}{Okay, I'll go with you.}
#{108}{}{No thanks. I've had enough guard duty.}
#{109}{}{Tuk.}
#{110}{}{Great! Let's get out of here!}
#{111}{}{Okay, I understand.}
#{112}{}{I'll make due.}
#{113}{}{All right.}
#{114}{}{Are you all right?}
#{115}{}{I think you need some rest.}
#{116}{}{Uh, I think you should see the Brotherhood's Doctor.}
#{117}{}{We lost the boss. Can you come back with us? We can still pay you
# the 400 scripts.}
#{118}{}{Our Driver was a good person . . . a terrible loss. I can still pay
# you the 400 scripts if you want to come back with us to the Hub.}
#{119}{}{I'll get us back if you want to come with us. The pay'll be the
# same.}
#{120}{}{Wow, I can't believe we're the only two left. I'll go with you,
# but if I don't make it you won't get paid the 400 scripts.}
#{121}{}{That was pretty nasty. If you really want, I can get you
# another 400 scripts if you come back to the Hub with me. It's too
# dangerous for one person.}
#{122}{}{You'll get another 400 scripts if you can get me and the caravan
# back safely to the Hub, but only if I make it. You've got to cover
# me if we get in a fight.}
#{123}{}{So, did you change your mind?}
#{124}{}{Yes, I'll take the job.}
#{125}{}{No.}
#{126}{}{Hra?}
#{127}{}{Sorry, we're not going back to the Hub today.}
#{128}{}{Um, sorry. I don't think we need you for the return trip.}
#{129}{}{Talk to our Caravan Driver if you want to hire on.}
#{130}{}{Hi there. If you're looking for some work, see our Caravan
# Driver.}
#{131}{}{Why, hello.}
#{132}{}{Sorry, can't talk.}
#{133}{}{Coming back to the Hub with us?}
#{134}{}{I love Caravan duty, lots of action and caps.}
#{135}{}{The Far Go Traders are great to work for.}
#{136}{}{I like working for the Far Go Traders; they don't take stupid risks.}
#{137}{}{The Crimson Caravan's caravans are the best.}
#{138}{}{The Crimson Caravan pays so well, I'll retire in a year.}
#{139}{}{Talk to the other guard if you want to come back with us.}  
#{140}{}{Here're your caps. We could use a hand getting back if you can.}

{100}{}{你看到商队保镖。}
{101}{}{老板居然挂了。你愿意跟我们回去吗？我们会付给你４００个瓶盖。}
{102}{}{车夫死了，真惨。罗格尔会不高兴的。如果你愿意随我们回哈勃城，我们会付你相同的薪水。}
{103}{}{你愿意跟来吗？我会赶车。报酬价格一样。}
{104}{}{我不知道你怎么打算的。我可以再这里等下一趟商队，我可不想自己一个人回去。如果你也想回去，我就跟你走，但如果我路上挂了，你就拿不到那４００个瓶盖了。}
{105}{}{路上真糟糕。如果你能陪我回哈勃城，我会再给你４００个瓶盖。一个人走太危险了。}
{106}{}{如果你能帮助车队和我安全返回哈勃城，我会再给你４００个瓶盖，但是如果我路上挂了，你就没钱拿了。打仗时，你要掩护我。}
{107}{}{好，我跟你走。}
{108}{}{不，谢了，我做够保安了。}
{109}{}{呼。}
{110}{}{好极了！我们走！}
{111}{}{好吧，我能理解。}
{112}{}{我会尽力的。}
{113}{}{好的。}
{114}{}{你还好么？}
{115}{}{我觉得你应该休息休息。}
{116}{}{我觉得你应该去兄弟会的医生那里治疗一下。}
{117}{}{我们老板死了，你能跟我们回去么？价钱还是一样，我们会付给你４００个瓶盖。}
{118}{}{车夫是个好人……没想到，唉，真可怜。你能跟我们回哈勃城去吗？价钱还是一样，我们会付给你４００个瓶盖。}
{119}{}{如果你跟我们走，我会把队伍带回去。给你的工钱照旧。}
{120}{}{天，没想到只剩下我们两个人了。我可以跟你回去，但如果我路上挂了，你就拿不到那４００个瓶盖了。}
{121}{}{真惨烈啊。你能跟我们回哈勃城去吗？价钱还是一样，我们会付给你４００个瓶盖。单独回去太危险了。}
{122}{}{如果你能帮助商队和我安全返回哈勃城，我会再给你４００个瓶盖，但是如果我路上挂了，你就没瓶盖拿了。记得开战时要保护我。}
{123}{}{那么，你改主意了？}
{124}{}{好，我干。}
{125}{}{不干。}
{126}{}{哈？}
{127}{}{抱歉，我们今天不回哈勃城。}
{128}{}{嗯，对不起，我们不需要你帮助我们回程。}
{129}{}{如果你想继续干，和车夫说吧。}
{130}{}{嗨，如果你想找活儿干，和我们车夫说去。}
{131}{}{嘿，你好。}
{132}{}{抱歉，我现在不能聊天。}
{133}{}{想和我们回哈勃城吗？}
{134}{}{我喜欢保镖的活儿，又刺激又有钱拿。}
{135}{}{远行商队是个好主顾。}
{136}{}{我喜欢为远行商队保镖，他们不会乱冒险。}
{137}{}{深红商队是最棒的。}
{138}{}{深红商队钱给得多，我一年后就可以退休了，哈。}
{139}{}{如果你想跟我们回程，和另外一个保镖谈。}  
{140}{}{这是你的钱，如果你方便的话，你可以帮我们回程。}
