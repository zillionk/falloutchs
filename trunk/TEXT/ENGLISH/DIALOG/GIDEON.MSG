{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}


# {100}{}{You see Gideon, a normal looking human. He is wearing a crown.}
# {101}{}{Jason is a living god! Only the nullified may pass!}
# {102}{}{Nullified? Are they somehow restricting your psychic powers by those
 # devices you are wearing?}
# {103}{}{Who's Jason?}
# {104}{}{What do you mean by nullified?}
# {105}{}{I just killed him, so he must be a dead god, now. Would you like to
 # join him?}
# {106}{}{Huh?}
# {107}{}{The walls also have minds . . . I saw you . . . tomorrow?}
# {108}{}{Others like you are in the wall?}
# {109}{}{Never mind.}
# {110}{}{I'd like to kill you now. Could you open this force field?}
# {111}{}{Open the forcefield and I'll let you out.}
# {112}{}{Uh, yeah. Are you the 'experiments' I'm looking for?}
# {113}{}{Jason? Who's Jason?}
# {114}{}{You just said . . . nevermind.}
{100}{}{你看见基登，一个看上去平平常常的男人，头上顶着精神冲击器。}
{101}{}{贾森是活在这个世上的神！只有废弃者才有资格通过！}
{102}{}{废弃者？他们用那个戴在你头上的东西让你变得虚弱无力？}
{103}{}{贾森是哪个家伙？}
{104}{}{什么样子的人算是被废弃者？}
{105}{}{我刚把他宰了，他已经不再是活在这个世界上的神了。你还要跟着他一起混吗？}
{106}{}{啊？}
{107}{}{那些墙壁也有他们自己的灵魂……那咱们……明天见？}
{108}{}{其他像你一样的家伙被砌到墙里边了？}
{109}{}{没什么。}
{110}{}{我他娘的现在想宰了你。你能打开这个力场？}
{111}{}{开启这个力场的话我就放了你。}
{112}{}{啊，耶，你不就是我一直在找的“试验品”么？}
{113}{}{贾森？他是什么鸟人？}
{114}{}{你刚才说？……没什么。}
# {115}{}{Stup.}
# {116}{}{Yes, the walls are alive with those that have gone before.}
# {117}{}{What happened to them?}
# {118}{}{Uh, I've got to go.}
# {119}{}{Meeting of the soul . . . melded with, to protect, the Master of all.}
# {120}{}{I see. How do I protect myself from the protectors of the Master?}
# {121}{}{What about the dogs of war?}
# {122}{}{I need to protect the Master. How do I get to him?}
# {123}{}{I can kill anyone or anything. Open this forcefield and I'll
 # demonstrate.}
# {124}{}{Goodbye.}
# {125}{}{There is only peace and joining . . . the price . . . the pain . . . one must be
 # blind . . . nulled.}
# {126}{}{Well, I need to join. Where can I pick up one of those snazzy nullifiers?}
# {127}{}{Great! How do I join?}
# {128}{}{I'd like to join my gun with your head!}
# {129}{}{I don't have time for this. Goodbye.}
{115}{}{住嘴！}
{116}{}{是啊，那些墙拥有那些前人的生命。}
{117}{}{他们发生了什么事情？}
{118}{}{啊，我该走了。}
{119}{}{与灵魂接触……并融合，借此手段来保护主教。}
{120}{}{我知道了，我怎么在主教的守卫面前保护自己？}
{121}{}{那么这些走狗怎么样？}
{122}{}{我要去保护主教，怎样才能到达他的身边？}
{123}{}{我无往而不利，打开力场，看我示范给你看。}
{124}{}{再见。}
{125}{}{那里只有和平与融合……斤斤计较的利害得失……痛苦与烦恼……空虚与迷惘，都消失得无影无踪。}
{126}{}{好啊，我也想加入。我到那里去才能找到一个这样时髦的废弃者呢？}
{127}{}{太棒了，我怎么加入？}
{128}{}{我要把我的枪和你的脑袋融为一体。}
{129}{}{我没时间里会这种东西，再见。}
{130}{}{我将为你施刷油礼……我将为你讲解教会的禁忌。}
# {130}{}{I will anoint you . . . I must give what I must not.}
# {131}{}{Thanks.}
# {132}{}{No one's anointing me, you insane bastard!}
# {133}{}{Anoint? Anoint me with what?}
# {134}{}{No, thanks.}
# {135}{}{You cannot kill the genius of . . . the all . . .  you . . . hehf!}
# {136}{}{Yeah, but I can cause it one hell of a lot of pain.}
# {137}{}{I don't want to kill. I want to worship.}
# {138}{}{Obviously. Goodbye.}
# {139}{}{Phlegm! Insubstantial development . . . communication, null . . . end of death.}
# {140}{}{The walls also have minds . . . I saw you . . . tomorrow was it?}
# {141}{}{I'll take that as a yes.}
# {142}{}{Great! How do I join?}
# {143}{}{The blasphemous . . . decompose . . . death will be . . . salvation . . . strong!}
# {144}{}{The minds . . . the walls . . . before the great one.}
# {145}{}{Those who have gone before . . . must stop your journey.}
# {146}{}{I need to change that.}
# {147}{}{I must complete my journey -- the master wills it.}
# {148}{}{Who? Did what?}
{131}{}{多谢你。}
{132}{}{没有人来在我身上刷油，你这个疯掉的杂种！}
{133}{}{刷油？往我身上刷什么油？}
{134}{}{不必，谢了。}
{135}{}{你没办法杀掉……他这个……天才中的天才……你这个蠢货。}
{136}{}{耶，不过我可以把它变成一个充满痛苦的地狱。}
{137}{}{我要朝拜，不愿杀戮。}
{138}{}{还用说吗，再会吧。}
{139}{}{我呸！虚无缥缈的发展……融合、空虚，最终必然死亡！}
{140}{}{那些墙也是有他们自己的灵魂的……我看你……明天也是那样子了？}
{141}{}{我同意了，自然会去做的。}
{142}{}{太棒了，我怎么加入啊？}
{143}{}{亵渎……腐烂……死亡使其得到救赎……并且变得强大。}
{144}{}{那些灵魂……那些墙体……就在这个世界上最伟大的存在之前。}
{145}{}{那些前人……一定阻挡了你前进的脚步}
{146}{}{我要改变这一切。}
{147}{}{我必须完成我的旅程――这是大主教的意志。}
{148}{}{谁？发生了什么？}
# {149}{}{Yeah, but I can cause them a whole lot of pain.}
# {150}{}{Sorry to disturb you again. Goodbye.}
# {151}{}{I'd like to help you escape.}
# {200}{}{You see Moore, a scruffy looking fellow. He is wearing a crown.}
# {201}{}{You see a scruffy looking fellow.}
# {202}{}{The asphalt shall run red! I will crush!}
# {203}{}{Exactly.}
# {204}{}{What are you talking about?}
# {205}{}{Yeah, it'll be red with your blood.}
# {206}{}{Uh, yeah. Goodbye.}
# {207}{}{Urgh!}
# {208}{}{I will stop the motor! The master gave me the power . . .}
# {209}{}{Okay, Hank. I'd like to meet the Master, how do I get there?}
# {210}{}{What motor?}
{149}{}{好啊，不过我可以让他们无比痛苦。}
{150}{}{很抱歉再次打扰你，再见。}
{151}{}{我想帮助你离开。}
{200}{}{你看见穆尔，一个脏兮兮的家伙。头戴精神冲击器。}
{201}{}{你看见一个脏兮兮的家伙。}
{202}{}{沥青烧红了，我要爆炸了。}
{203}{}{正好。}
{204}{}{你说什么呢？}
{205}{}{有了你的血，就变红了。}
{206}{}{呃，还是再见吧。}
{207}{}{啊！}
{208}{}{我要关掉那个马达，大主教会赐给我力量！}
{209}{}{好的汉克，我打算见见那个大主教，怎么找他？}
{210}{}{什么马达？}
{211}{}{当然！我完全理解……}
# {211}{}{Of course! I understand completely . . .}
# {212}{}{I'd like to split your head open, you blithering idiot.}
# {213}{}{Oh, not you again. Goodbye.}
# {214}{}{Only the powerful can pass, but they will be kept from passing.}
# {215}{}{Open this force field, I want to show you my power.}
# {216}{}{But I have to see the Master!}
# {217}{}{Can you show me how?}
# {218}{}{Gideon . . . Gideon speaks the way.}
# {219}{}{Exactly.}
# {300}{}{You see Lucy, a normal looking human female. She is wearing a crown.}
# {301}{}{You see a human female. She is staring at your shoes.}
# {302}{}{There is no place like home, no place like home, no place like home . . .
 # 【pacing back and forth】}
# {303}{}{Hng!}
# {304}{}{Stop that!}
# {305}{}{What about this place? Isn't this your home?}
# {306}{}{I agree. Completely and utterly. You're right . . . 【she pauses for a
 # moment.】 What did you say? Oh, never you mind.}
{212}{}{我要撬开你的脑袋，你这个聒噪的废柴。}
{213}{}{噢，依然不是找你，再见。}
{214}{}{只有有力的方能通过，不过他们不会得到允许。}
{215}{}{打开力场，我将向你展示我的力量。}
{216}{}{可是我要进去见主教啊！}
{217}{}{告诉我怎么做？}
{218}{}{基登……基登知道路。}
{219}{}{具体点。}
{300}{}{你看见露西，一个平淡无奇的女人，头戴精神冲击器。}
{301}{}{你看见一个平淡无奇的女人，她正盯着你的鞋在看。}
{302}{}{没有什么地方能够像家一样，像家一样，像家一样……【来回的踱步】}
{303}{}{嗯？}
{304}{}{住手！}
{305}{}{那么这里呢？也不是你的家？}
{306}{}{我同意，绝对的，你是正确的【突然停顿了一小会】你说什么？我没有注意。}
# {307}{}{【looking at you intensely】 I will slay you for that! I will make your
 # blood run red. Wait a minute. Blood is red, how can I make it run red? I
 # can't very well do that. Hmmm. I need to think about this. Go away!}
# {308}{}{My home is, uh, yeah. Here. Yeah, it's here. This is my home! 【she
 # jumps up and down】 I am so happy! You can't believe how happy this makes me.
 # I think I'm going to go punch the wall for a while.}
# {309}{}{I'm busy. I almost have the solution to the environmental problems
 # fucking this world over, but I can't stop thinking about purple dinosaurs.
 # Is this a problem?}
# {310}{}{Stop bugging me, I'm thinking . . .}
# {400}{}{You see Wiggum, a complete loser. He is wearing a crown.}
# {401}{}{You see what looks to be a complete loser.}
# {402}{}{I'm tired.}
# {403}{}{My life is Hell.}
# {404}{}{I'm tired of living.}
# {405}{}{Darkness comes.}
# {406}{}{Whatever.}
# {500}{}{A sign on the wall reads: 'Warning! Do not Disturb!'}
# {501}{}{You gain }
# {502}{}{ experience points for convincing the psyker to give
 # you a Nullifier.}
{307}{}{【很专心的盯着你看】为了这个我要宰了你，让你的鲜血变红。等等，你的血就是红的，我还怎么把它变红？我做不到。唔，我要好好想想，你快走吧！}
{308}{}{我的家，啊，这。就是这，这就是我的家！【她跳来跳去】我好高兴，你想象不到这回让我多高兴。我打算一会就去把敲敲那堵墙。}
{309}{}{我很忙，我几乎找到了解决这个狗日的世界的环境问题的办法，但是我要整天担心那些紫色的恐龙，怎么办？}
{310}{}{别在这偷听，我正在思考}
{400}{}{你看见维葛普，一个彻头彻尾的失败者，头戴精神冲击器。}
{401}{}{你看见一个彻头彻尾的失败者。}
{402}{}{我累了。}
{403}{}{我简直就活在地狱！}
{404}{}{我活够了。}
{405}{}{黑暗降临了。}
{406}{}{一切！}
{500}{}{墙上的告示牌写着：“警告，禁止打扰。”}
{501}{}{你得到}
{502}{}{点经验值，因为你让赛科尔相信那玩意对你无效。}
