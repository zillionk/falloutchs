# {100}{}{You see a large well armed man.}
# {101}{}{You see Gabriel, leader of the Gun Runners.}
# {102}{}{It's not often that we get visitors, how can I help you?}
# {103}{}{Why don't you  get many visitors?}
# {104}{}{What is it you do here?}
# {105}{}{This place isn't very accessible with a nest of those damn Deathclaws right outside our factory.}
# {106}{}{You guys seem fairly well armed, why don't you go exterminate them?}
# {107}{}{We've gone over there and taken out a few, but they always seem to come back. Besides, we're machinists, not fighters.}
# {108}{}{What would you give me if I went in there and took care of them for you?}
# {109}{}{We manufacture weapons and ammunition.  We've been at this for the last 30 years.  But the last 10 have been hell.}
# {110}{}{Why is that?}
# {111}{}{We've stripped the area surrounding our factory of all the scrap metals that were left after the war.  Now we have to rely on Adytum to supply us with raw materials.}
# {112}{}{What's so bad about Adytum  supplying you with your materials?}
# {113}{}{At first it was fine.  They supplied us with raw materials, we manufactured and sold the weapons.  Then 3 years ago Zimmerman hired some mercenaries to help  protect Adytum from the deathclaw and the odd random attack by raiders.  Those Regulators are cold hearted bastards and are squeezing us for all we have.  We make the guns and they get rich off of it.}
# {114}{}{Why don't you just leave and set up some where else?}
# {115}{}{That's rough. What would you give me to take care of deathclaw?}
# {116}{}{We would if we could.  But moving is a major undertaking with all the lathes and mills.  These are things that aren't just picked up easily moved.  We could move but the deathclaw make it impossible.}
# {117}{}{You guys seem fairly well armed, why don't you go exterminate them?}
# {118}{}{If you could get rid of the Deathclaws once and for all you could name your price.}
# {119}{}{I want weapons and ammunition, and lots of it.}
# {120}{}{}
# {121}{}{If you clean out that area we'll be leaving, but we'll leave behind more weapons and ammunition than you could possibly use.}
# {122}{}{OK.  You got yourself a deal.}
# {123}{}{I'll have to think about it.}
# {124}{}{People who would fix all of your problems with Adytum.}
# {125}{}{You clear out the Deathclaws, all of them, and you got yourself a deal.}
# {126}{}{OK.  I'll do it.}
# {127}{}{I'll have to think about it.}
# {128}{}{Hello again.}
# {129}{}{What is it you do here?}
# {130}{}{Bye.}
# {131}{}{}
# {132}{}{It's been going OK.}
# {133}{}{I think I've killed all the Deathclaws.}
# {134}{}{We need to be sure.  We've killed over 20 in the past 2 years and they always seem to come back.  And we could never figure out how.  Let's give it a few days and if they are still gone we'll see what we can do for ya'.}
# {135}{}{OK Thanks}
# {136}{}{Let us know when you've taken care of the Deathclaws.}
# {137}{}{Yeah. See you around, maybe.}
# {138}{}{I know, tell me about it.}
# {139}{}{See you around, maybe.}
# {140}{}{It's not often that we get visitors, can I help you?}
# {141}{}{Why is  it that you don't get many visitors?}
# {142}{}{What is it you do here?}
# {143}{}{This place isn't very accessible, with a nest of those damn Deathclaw right outside our factory.}
# {144}{}{I've killed all the Deathclaws. Even all the damn eggs.}
# {145}{}{We would if we could.  But moving is a major under taking with all the lathes and mills.  These are things that aren't just picked up and easily moved.  We could move but the Deathclaw make it impossible.}
# {146}{}{I've killed all the Deathclaws. Even all the damn eggs.}
# {147}{}{}
# {148}{}{I want weapons and ammunition, and lots of it.}
# {149}{}{}
# {150}{}{No need to pay me.  Your thanks is enough.}
# {151}{}{You got it- just take whatever you want. We're pulling out of here in a day or two, but we'll leave more weapons and ammo than you could carry right now. Just come back here whenever you need them.}
# {152}{}{}
# {153}{}{}
# {154}{}{Thank you.}
# {155}{}{}
# {156}{}{No problem.}
# {157}{}{}
# {158}{}{}
# {159}{}{Weren't you guys leaving?}
# {160}{}{I'm just here to pick up a few things. What do you got today?}
# {161}{}{Nothing. Thanks anyway.}
# {162}{}{}
# {163}{}{Great. What do you guys got today?}
# {164}{}{Well, I'll see you guys later.}
# {165}{}{}
# {166}{}{I'm just here to pick up a few things. What do you got today?}
# {167}{}{Nothing. Thanks anyway.}
# {168}{}{Sorry I can't talk to you now, I'm very busy.}
# {169}{}{Guns, I like Guns!}

{100}{}{你看见了一个全副武装的男人。}
{101}{}{你看见了加百利, 军火商的老大。}
{102}{}{我们不常有访客，有什么需要我效劳的么？}
{103}{}{为什么这里访客不多？}
{104}{}{你在这里是做什么的？}
{105}{}{基地外边有个死亡爪的巢穴，所以来我们这里一趟很不容易。}
{106}{}{你小子看起来装备不错么，干吗不过去摆平它们？}
{107}{}{我们尝试着去干掉了一部分，但是杯水车薪。你要知道我们是机械师，不是军人。}
{108}{}{如果我帮你去照顾一下那些死亡爪小朋友的话，你会给我什么好处呢？}
{109}{}{我们在这里生产军火有三十年了，但最近十年简直不是人过的日子。}
{110}{}{怎么了？}
{111}{}{我们用战争遗留下来的金属残骸建造了隔离带。现在我们只能依赖爱迪托姆城提供的原料金属了。}
{112}{}{这么做有什么好处？}
{113}{}{好处大大的，他们向我们出口原料金属并且进口我们生产的军火。三年前爱迪托姆城雇用了一些雇佣兵来保护他们免受死亡爪一些小股土匪的侵袭。这支训练有素的部队简直就是一群冷血的禽兽，他们竭尽所能的压榨我们，剥削我们的财富。我们千辛万苦生产的军火养肥了他们。}
{114}{}{那何不换个地方另起炉灶？}
{115}{}{听着就叫人不爽，要是我帮你解决了死亡爪，能得到什么好处？}
{116}{}{办得到我们肯定办。但是这次搬家我们要带走所有的设备，这些可不是说带走就带走的东西，死亡爪是我们的最大威胁。}
{117}{}{你小子看起来装备的也不错啊，干吗不去干掉他们？}
{118}{}{只要你处理了那些死亡爪，你要的东西都随你开价。}
{119}{}{我需要大批量的武器装备。}
{120}{}{}
{121}{}{如果你能扫清这个区域的威胁我们将离开这里，然后我们将给你留下多到无法想象的军火装备。}
{122}{}{好啊，尽快决定吧。}
{123}{}{我得好好想想。}
{124}{}{我就是你们和爱迪托姆城救世主。}
{125}{}{你要是干掉所有的死亡爪，注意，所有的，那么我们就成交。}
{126}{}{好吧，成交。}
{127}{}{我得好好想想。}
{128}{}{朋友，还有什么事情？}
{129}{}{你在这是管什么的？}
{130}{}{再见。}
{131}{}{}
{132}{}{情况很快就会好转。}
{133}{}{我解决了所有的死亡爪。}
{134}{}{我们需要确认一下。过去两年时间里我们消灭了２０多只死亡爪，但是他们一直以来不曾消失。没人说得清到底有多少，我们过几天去看看是否还有死亡爪然后再确定交易有效怎么样？}
{135}{}{好的，多谢你了。}
{136}{}{你们是什么时候去照顾那些死亡爪小朋友的？}
{137}{}{好，回见，如果一切属实。}
{138}{}{晓得了，跟我仔细说说吧。}
{139}{}{好啊，回头见吧，如果一切如你所言。}
{140}{}{我们这里难得有人来访，有什么需要我帮忙的么？}
{141}{}{为什么这里的访客这么少？}
{142}{}{你在这是管哪一摊的？}
{143}{}{这地方不是那么容易来的，出了基地不远就有个死亡爪的巢穴。}
{144}{}{我杀了所有死亡爪，连他们的蛋蛋也没有放过。}
{145}{}{能的话我们自然会搬，但是那些加工设备都很笨重，不是能装身上带走的不杀光所有的死亡爪我们就没有办法搬家。}
{146}{}{我杀光了所有的死亡爪，以及他们的下一代。}
{147}{}{}
{148}{}{我需要枪支弹药，越多越好。}
{149}{}{}
{150}{}{不用了，一句感谢就够了。}
{151}{}{我们就要搬家了，这里所有的军火都是你的，带不走得可以随时回来取。}
{152}{}{}
{153}{}{}
{154}{}{谢谢你。}
{155}{}{}
{156}{}{没问题。}
{157}{}{}
{158}{}{}
{159}{}{嗨，你小子怎么还没走？}
{160}{}{还有点东西没拿，今天你怎么样？}
{161}{}{一如既往，感谢你的关心}
{162}{}{}
{163}{}{爽得很，你呢？怎么样？}
{164}{}{还不错，咱哥们回头见了。}
{165}{}{}
{166}{}{还有点东西没有拿，你今天怎么样？}
{167}{}{没什么特别的，承蒙关心。}
{168}{}{不好意思，我正忙，没工夫招呼你。}
{169}{}{武器！！我太他妈的爱你们了！！}

{170}{}{我的一帮兄弟肯定用得到你这些家伙。}
{171}{}{我的一些朋友肯定需要这些好用的武器。}
{172}{}{事办得怎么样了？哥们。}
{173}{}{事情进展如何啊，我亲爱的朋友。}
{174}{}{你干的？把这帮兔崽子全宰了？哈里路亚！我们现在有取之不尽的原材料了，再也不用靠那帮俺迪托姆的傻蛋了。给它取个名字，宝贝，现在它是你的了。}
{175}{}{这真的是你干的么？你居然把他们全都杀死了，天啊，我们现在有足够的原料了，再也不用靠那些讨厌的安迪托姆人了。给它个名字，我的朋友，现在你是他的主人了。}
{176}{}{很公平，跟你做生意真痛快，哥们。}
{177}{}{成交，很高兴这笔交易成功了，朋友。}
{178}{}{成交，告诉你的弟兄们他们都要有趁手的家伙了。}
{179}{}{这是你要的东西。通知你的队友吧，这些武器跟他们都很配的。}
{180}{}{谢了，哥们。}
{181}{}{感谢你我的朋友。}
{182}{}{哥们，我这边正好有活要忙，你自己招呼自己吧。}
{183}{}{不好意思我这边游工作要做，你自己随意，不要客气。}
{184}{}{现在你们不用离开了，这帮狗日的土匪都被我们给清了。}
{185}{}{这些害人的家伙已经被我们清剿了，你们已经不再需要离开了。}
{186}{}{嘿，兄弟，要我帮你干什么？}
{187}{}{欢迎你，朋友，有什么我能效劳的？}
