{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see a large well armed man.}
#{101}{}{You see Gabriel, leader of the Gun Runners.}
#{102}{}{It's not often that we get visitors, how can I help you?}
#{103}{}{Why don't you  get many visitors?}
#{104}{}{What is it you do here?}
#{105}{}{This place isn't very accessible with a nest of those damn Deathclaws right #outside our factory.}
#{106}{}{You guys seem fairly well armed, why don't you go exterminate them?}
#{107}{}{We've gone over there and taken out a few, but they always seem to come back. #Besides, we're machinists, not fighters.}
#{108}{}{What would you give me if I went in there and took care of them for you?}
#{109}{}{We manufacture weapons and ammunition.  We've been at this for the last 30 #years.  But the last 10 have been hell.}
#{110}{}{Why is that?}
#{111}{}{We've stripped the area surrounding our factory of all the scrap metals that #were left after the war.  Now we have to rely on Adytum to supply us with raw #materials.}
#{112}{}{What's so bad about Adytum  supplying you with your materials?}
#{113}{}{At first it was fine.  They supplied us with raw materials, we manufactured #and sold the weapons.  Then 3 years ago Zimmerman hired some mercenaries to help  #protect Adytum from the deathclaw and the odd random attack by raiders.  Those #Regulators are cold hearted bastards and are squeezing us for all we have.  We make #the guns and they get rich off of it.}
#{114}{}{Why don't you just leave and set up some where else?}
#{115}{}{That's rough. What would you give me to take care of deathclaw?}
#{116}{}{We would if we could.  But moving is a major undertaking with all the lathes #and mills.  These are things that aren't just picked up easily moved.  We could move #but the deathclaw make it impossible.}
#{117}{}{You guys seem fairly well armed, why don't you go exterminate them?}
#{118}{}{If you could get rid of the Deathclaws once and for all you could name your #price.}
#{119}{}{I want weapons and ammunition, and lots of it.}
#{120}{}{}
#{121}{}{If you clean out that area we'll be leaving, but we'll leave behind more #weapons and ammunition than you could possibly use.}
#{122}{}{OK.  You got yourself a deal.}
#{123}{}{I'll have to think about it.}
#{124}{}{People who would fix all of your problems with Adytum.}
#{125}{}{You clear out the Deathclaws, all of them, and you got yourself a deal.}
#{126}{}{OK.  I'll do it.}
#{127}{}{I'll have to think about it.}
#{128}{}{Hello again.}
#{129}{}{What is it you do here?}
#{130}{}{Bye.}
#{131}{}{}
#{132}{}{It's been going OK.}
#{133}{}{I think I've killed all the Deathclaws.}
#{134}{}{We need to be sure.  We've killed over 20 in the past 2 years and they always #seem to come back.  And we could never figure out how.  Let's give it a few days #and if they are still gone we'll see what we can do for ya'.}
#{135}{}{OK Thanks}
#{136}{}{Let us know when you've taken care of the Deathclaws.}
#{137}{}{Yeah. See you around, maybe.}
#{138}{}{I know, tell me about it.}
#{139}{}{See you around, maybe.}
#{140}{}{It's not often that we get visitors, can I help you?}
#{141}{}{Why is  it that you don't get many visitors?}
#{142}{}{What is it you do here?}
#{143}{}{This place isn't very accessible, with a nest of those damn Deathclaw right #outside our factory.}
#{144}{}{I've killed all the Deathclaws. Even all the damn eggs.}
#{145}{}{We would if we could.  But moving is a major under taking with all the lathes #and mills.  These are things that aren't just picked up and easily moved.  We could #move but the Deathclaw make it impossible.}
#{146}{}{I've killed all the Deathclaws. Even all the damn eggs.}
#{147}{}{}
#{148}{}{I want weapons and ammunition, and lots of it.}
#{149}{}{}
#{150}{}{No need to pay me.  Your thanks is enough.}
#{151}{}{You got it- just take whatever you want. We're pulling out of here in a day #or two, but we'll leave more weapons and ammo than you could carry right now. Just #come back here whenever you need them.}
#{152}{}{}
#{153}{}{}
#{154}{}{Thank you.}
#{155}{}{}
#{156}{}{No problem.}
#{157}{}{}
#{158}{}{}
#{159}{}{Weren't you guys leaving?}
#{160}{}{I'm just here to pick up a few things. What do you got today?}
#{161}{}{Nothing. Thanks anyway.}
#{162}{}{}
#{163}{}{Great. What do you guys got today?}
#{164}{}{Well, I'll see you guys later.}
#{165}{}{}
#{166}{}{I'm just here to pick up a few things. What do you got today?}
#{167}{}{Nothing. Thanks anyway.}
#{168}{}{Sorry I can't talk to you now, I'm very busy.}
#{169}{}{Guns, I like Guns!}

{100}{}{你看到一个魁梧而且装备精良的人。}
{101}{}{你看到加布里尔，军火贩子的领袖。}
{102}{}{我们这里可不常有人来，我能帮你什么吗？}
{103}{}{为什么没什么人来这里呢？}
{104}{}{你在这做什么的？}
{105}{}{这地方可不是那么好进来的，有一窝该死的死亡爪就在我们工厂外面。}
{106}{}{你们装备那么好，为什么不出去干掉他们。}
{107}{}{我们去那干掉过一些，可总也杀不完啊。再说我们是造枪的，不是使枪的。}
{108}{}{如果我为你们干掉了那些死亡爪，你们要给我什么报酬呢。}
{109}{}{我们制造枪械弹药。我们做这一行三十年了，不过近十年很不好过。}
{110}{}{为什么？}
{111}{}{以前我们在工厂附近战前留下的那些金属垃圾里找原料。现在我们得依靠内城区提供我们原材料。}
{112}{}{内城区提供你们物资有什么不好？}
{113}{}{开始也没什么。他们提供物资，我们制造枪械来卖。但三年前齐默曼雇佣了一些佣兵来保护内城区不受强盗和死亡爪的侵扰。那些佣兵压榨我们，抢夺我们的东西，是群无情的混蛋。我们造的枪械倒便宜了他们。}
{114}{}{为什么不去别的地方落脚？}
{115}{}{是挺倒霉的。我料理那些死亡爪的话有什么报酬？}
{116}{}{能的话我们早走了。但是搬迁是个大工程，我们有车床和轧钢机器，这些东西可不是能拎起来就走的。我们就是能走还有那些死亡爪挡着呢。}
{117}{}{你们装备这么好，为什么不去搞定那些死亡爪？}
{118}{}{要是你能一起搞定那些死亡爪，随便你开价。}
{119}{}{我要很多枪械和弹药，很多。}
{120}{}{}
{121}{}{你能清理那地区的话我们就会搬走，但我们会留下很多武器弹药，你用都用不完的。}
{122}{}{好。成交。}
{123}{}{我再考虑一下。}
{124}{}{能解决你们跟内城区所有问题的人。}
{125}{}{你清理掉那些死亡爪，全部的死亡爪，就成交。}
{126}{}{好的。我接受。}
{127}{}{我会考虑的。}
{128}{}{你好，又是我。}
{129}{}{你在这是做什么的？}
{130}{}{再见。}
{131}{}{}
{132}{}{没问题的。}
{133}{}{我想我已经杀了所有的死亡爪。}
{134}{}{我们得确认一下。过去两年我们杀了２０只，可它们总是会再出现。我们根本没办法。过几天之后如果他们没有再出现，我们会给你报酬的。}
{135}{}{好，谢了。}
{136}{}{如果你杀掉了所有死亡爪就通知我们。}
{137}{}{好，再见了，也许再不见……}
{138}{}{我明白，跟我说说。}
{139}{}{再见了，也许再不见……}
{140}{}{我们这里可不常有人来，能帮你什么吗？}
{141}{}{为什么没什么人来你们这呢？}
{142}{}{你在这做什么的？}
{143}{}{这地方可不是那么好进来的，有一窝该死的死亡爪就在我们工厂外面。}
{144}{}{我杀了所有的死亡爪，连那些该死的蛋也没放过。}
{145}{}{能的话我们早走了。但是搬迁是个大工程，我们有车床和轧钢机器，这些东西可不是能拎起来就走的。我们就是能走还有那些死亡爪挡着呢。}
{146}{}{我杀了所有的死亡爪，连那些该死的蛋也没放过。}
{147}{}{}
{148}{}{我要武器和弹药，要很多。}
{149}{}{}
{150}{}{不用给我报酬，一声谢谢就够了。}
{151}{}{没问题，想要什么尽管拿吧。我们这两天就要搬走了，但我们会留下很多武器弹药的，你拿都拿不了。需要的时候再回来拿吧。}
{152}{}{}
{153}{}{}
{154}{}{谢谢你。}
{155}{}{}
{156}{}{小意思。}
{157}{}{}
{158}{}{}
{159}{}{你们不是要走了吗？}
{160}{}{我只是来拿些东西，今天有什么东西吗？}
{161}{}{没什么，还是谢谢了。}
{162}{}{}
{163}{}{好的，现在有什么东西？}
{164}{}{好吧，再见拉。}

{166}{}{我只是来拿些东西，今天有什么东西吗？}
{167}{}{没什么，还是谢谢了。}
{168}{}{抱歉，现在不能聊天，我很忙。}
