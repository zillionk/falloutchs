#{162}{}{They got any holy wine around this joint? }

{165}{}{我们这除了隐形人之外没有守卫。不知道你指的是什么？}

#{166}{}{The Master ordered extra security. Not sure why, I think the Nightkin are enough muscle as it is. You got any idea what's going on? }
{166}{}{主教命令我们增强守卫。我不知道为什么，在我看来那些隐形人已经足够了。你知道为什么会这样吗？}

#{167}{}{Someone screwed up my orders. Don't mind me. }
{167}{}{肯定是有人把命令弄混了。不能怪我。}

#{168}{}{I'm not one of the Cathedral guards, I'm one of the patrols. }

#{169}{}{We don't? Oh shit! }

#{170}{}{I'm...ah...Oh well, nothing that can't be solved with a bullet. DIE! }
{170}{}{我是……啊……噢对了，没有子弹解决不了的事。死吧！}

#{171}{}{My apologies. Praise the Master, and have a nice day. }

#{174}{}{I'm sure it is. 【Groan】. }
{174}{}{我相信是这样的。【叹息】}

#{175}{}{What kind of a Cathedral doesn't even have holy wine? }
{175}{}{圣童教的信徒竟然会没有圣酒？}

#{176}{}{Fine, so I'll have to kill you when I'm sober. Like now. Die, you son of a bitch! }
{176}{}{很好，我不得不在清醒的状况下杀死你了。就像现在这样。死吧，你这王八操的！}

{177}{}{很多人尝试过杀死主教，但他们都失败了。不过如果你尝试做这种徒劳的行动，主教也许会原谅你，还会找到你应有的用处。我会为你祈祷的。}

{178}{}{我只是开玩笑。常年在废土上生活的人都有种奇怪的幽默感，你知道的。最近有什么事发生了吗？}

#{179}{}{We'll see about that.. }
{179}{}{我们会看着的……}

#{180}{}{Nobody prays for my soul. But somebody better start praying for you, because I'm killing you right now! }
{180}{}{没有人为我的灵魂祈祷。但最好现在有人开始为你祈祷，因为我马上就要杀死你！}

#{181}{}{You have come to the wrong place, friend. This place is not about power. This place is about peace. }
{181}{}{你来到这里是错的，朋友。这里并不是展示力量的场所，这里是展示和平的场所。}

#{182}{}{I hear that our Crusade goes well. Soon we shall bring Peace and Unity to the Boneyard, and all the surrounding communities  Isn't it great? }
{182}{}{我听说我们的讨伐行动进行得很顺利。我们很快就要将和平和统一带至晒骨场以及周围的城市。多么伟大的行动啊！}

#{183}{}{Who's next on the list to receive Peace and Unity? }
{183}{}{下一个获得和平统一的地方是哪里呢？}

#{184}{}{That's rather vague. Have you heard anything else? }
{184}{}{我不太明白你说的。你听说过其他的什么吗？}

#{185}{}{Good. About time someone cleaned up this dump. }
{185}{}{很好。与此同时会有人清除这堆垃圾。}

#{186}{}{Yes. Isn't death grand. }
{186}{}{是的。死亡多么伟大啊。}

#{187}{}{The person that you seek is Father Morpheus. He can be found in the tower. Is that all? }
{187}{}{你该找的人是墨菲斯神父。他在塔里。够了吗？}

#{188}{}{Is there anything I should know before I meet him? }
{188}{}{在我见他之前我是不是还该知道些别的事情？}

#{189}{}{We'll see about that.. }
{189}{}{我们会看着的……}

#{190}{}{Thanks! Fresh meat at last! }
{190}{}{谢谢！终于有新鲜的肉了！}

#{191}{}{Is there something else on your mind, my child? }

#{196}{}{They got any holy wine around this joint? }
{196}{}{这附近有什么圣酒吗？}

#{197}{}{I was wondering what you'd look like if some maniac spilt your brains all over this nice Cathedral floor. Let's find out! }
{197}{}{我看你脑子里是不是生了蛆了？多到可以爬满这个教堂的地板。让我们看看吧！}

#{198}{}{You have a very good sense of humor, my child. Just don't tell jokes to Brother Lasher. }
{198}{}{你的幽默感很不错，我的孩子。不过千万不要和拉舍尔兄弟说笑话。}

#{199}{}{Are there any other servants of the Master I should watch out for? }
{199}{}{还有哪些主教的仆人是我应该注意的呢？}

#{205}{}{I fear you may have had too much sun. I hope you find healing here. Praise the Master! Praise the Holy Flame! }
{205}{}{恐怕你是晒太阳晒多了。希望你能在这里得到治愈。赞美主教！赞美圣火！}

#{206}{}{Your words are full of such pain and hate! I pity you, my friend, but pity can be turned to joy. Seek Father Morpheus in the tower. He is a wonderful man, and can open your heart to love again. }
{206}{}{}{}{你的语言充满了苦大仇深！我为你感到遗憾，我的朋友，但遗憾也可以转变为欢乐。去找塔中的墨菲斯神父。他是个非常好的人，能够开启你的心灵，令你重获爱的能力。}

#{207}{}{Have you never been to the Cathedral before? This is a place of Peace and Unity. This is a place where differences are forgotten and we seek a future of unity and prosperity for all. A future where the horrors that our ancestors inflicted on us c#an never happen again! }
{207}{}{你以前从来没来到过大教堂吗？这里是属于和平、统一的地方。这里是所有种族间的差异都被遗忘的地方，而我们为所有种族的繁荣努力着。在未来，我们祖先所造成的灾难和痛苦将永远不复存在！}

#{213}{}{I agree. I prefer to inflict my own horrors on people. }
{213}{}{我同意。我更喜欢把我自己制造的灾难和痛苦加在你这种人身上。}

#{214}{}{Our enemies slander us! People are so easily frightened, especially when someone tells them what to do! But since I follow the Master and the Holy Flame, I don't have to be afraid any more. The Master told me not to be afraid! }
{214}{}{我们的敌人诽谤我们！大家都轻易地被吓倒了，尤其是当某些人告诉他们该做什么的时候！但是自从我跟随主教和圣火以来，我再也不必害怕了。主教告诉我不必害怕的！}

#{215}{}{And how do we achieve this perfect Utopia? }
{215}{}{我们将如何到达这一个乌托邦呢？}

#{216}{}{Good for the Master! Any idea where I can find him? }
{216}{}{主教是好样的！你能告诉我在哪里能找到他吗？}

#{224}{}{Anyone ever tell you that you're a zombie? }
{224}{}{有人告诉过你你是个僵尸吗？}

#{225}{}{Let's praise him over a few bottles of holy wine. Praising goes a lot better when the spirit moves you.. }

{227}{}{哦，那个武器。}

#{228}{}{Um, is it loaded? }
{228}{}{嗯，它上膛了吗？}

#{229}{}{I don't know much. The mind of the Master is so great.. I do know that the Children are marching north. We will take control of all of the settlements, and baptize everyone! The baptism will change us and bring us closer to God, so we can have pe#ace and unity, and there will never be war or destruction again! }
{229}{}{我不知道的太多了。主教的灵魂是如此伟大……但我确实知道圣童在向北移动。我们将占领所有定居点，让所有的人都接受洗礼！洗礼将会改变我们，让我们更接近神，让我们得到和平与同一，从此之后将不会再有战争或是毁灭了！}

#{230}{}{And where is the baptismal font? }
{230}{}{那么洗礼用的圣盘在哪里？}

#{231}{}{That sounds like he's going to dump everybody in the FEV-2 Virus! }
{231}{}{听起来似乎是说他要把所有人都扔进ＦＥＶ二代的大病毒槽里！}

#{232}{}{What a wonderful day that's going to be! }
{232}{}{那真是超级棒的一天！}

#{233}{}{Well I've heard all I need to know. }

#{235}{}{Praise the Master! Peace be with you! Enjoy your stay at the Cathedral. }
{235}{}{赞美主教！和平与你同在！祝你在教堂过得快乐。}

#{236}{}{This is a sanctuary, where those who wish to build a peaceful future can go, in order to realize their vision. }
{236}{}{这里是一个圣地，那些想把他们对于和平未来的理想实现的人都可以来到这里。}

#{237}{}{And what right do you have to impose your future on everyone? }
{237}{}{你有什么权利把你们的未来强加在所有人身上？}

#{238}{}{But people have to leave sanctuaries and go out into the wide world. Otherwise, a sanctuary becomes a prison. }

#{242}{}{I'm glad to hear you express an interest in peace. Talk with Father Morpheus and Brother Lasher. They can instruct you further. }
{242}{}{很高兴你表达出了对于和平的兴趣。去和墨菲斯神父还有拉舍尔兄弟谈谈，他们将给你进一步的启示。}

#{243}{}{I'm afraid I can't help you. Only Father Morpheus communes with the Master. You can find him in the tower. }
{243}{}{很抱歉我帮不了你。只有墨菲斯神父和主教有联系。你可以在塔中找到他。}

#{244}{}{Is there anything I should know before I meet him? }
{244}{}{在我见他之前你还能告诉我什么？}

#{245}{}{Thanks. Be seeing you. }
{245}{}{谢谢。再见。}

#{246}{}{Father Morpheus. That's a real peaceful sounding name. Who's his assistant, Brother Murder? Brother Death? Sister Kill maybe? }
{246}{}{墨菲斯的意思是“梦神”啊。听起来的确是一个和平的名字。那么谁是他的助手呢？“谋杀”兄弟？“死亡”兄弟？也许是“杀戮”姐妹？}

#{247}{}{I am more than willing to be reborn for my cause. Kill me if you must, but I will be redeemed and you will die. }
{247}{}{我非常愿意为我们的事业而重生。要是你想要杀我的话，就动手好了，但我会重生，我会得到救赎，而你将会死去。}

#{248}{}{Kid, one way or another, you're spilling your guts right now! }
{248}{}{随你怎么说，小兔崽子，你马上就要死啦！}

#{249}{}{I'd be happy if you just shut up. You zombies are giving me a headache. }
{249}{}{要是你闭上嘴我会很高兴的。你们僵尸总是让我头痛。}

#{250}{}{You got guts, kid. I admire that. Maybe I won't kill you. }
{250}{}{你很有勇气，僵尸，值得敬佩。也许我不该杀死你。}

#{251}{}{I don't give a rat's ass about your soul, kid, but I'll be damned if I turn down the invitation. One martyr, coming up! }
{251}{}{我大概感觉你的灵魂和他妈的变种老鼠的屁股一个样，但是你继续这样下去我就该收拾你了。醒醒把，神棍！}

#{252}{}{Well... Uh.. Peace be with you.. I think... Farewell.. }
{252}{}{嗯……啊……愿和平与你同在。我想……再见。}

#{253}{}{Look around you? Do you not hear the messages? How can you doubt the Master's sincerity? }

#{254}{}{Nobody wants peace. Everyone's out for numero uno, pal. Wake up! }
{254}{}{没有人需要和平。伙计,现在大家都只为自己卖命。醒醒吧！}

#{255}{}{It's easy to talk about peace, but what's the Master really doing? }
{255}{}{谈论和平自然是很简单的，但主教在做什么呢？}

#{256}{}{Forgive me, brother. The world is such a terrible place, and I worry about losing our freedom.. }
{256}{}{原谅我，兄弟。这世界是个可怕的地方，而我害怕丢掉我的自由。}

#{257}{}{It's easy to talk about peace, but I hear terrible rumors of mutant armies.. }

#{258}{}{Maybe you're right. Who do I see to sign up? }
{258}{}{也许你是对的。我想加入，该去见谁呢？}

#{259}{}{Sincerity only comes out of the barrel of a gun! }
{259}{}{只有枪杆子里才有真诚！}

#{260}{}{He is Keeper of the Holy Flame, one who strives to wipe away all divisions, all hatreds. He wields both sword and plowshare, but would rather build than destroy. Hail the Master! Hail Unity! }
{260}{}{他是圣火的保护者，他毕生经历都用在了打破种族间的偏见，扫除所有仇恨的事业上。他同时掌控着剑和犁，但比起破坏，他更喜欢建设。向主教致敬！向大同世界致敬！}

#{261}{}{I hear that our Crusade goes well. We are marching north, and as the Master promised, the forces of the Dark Age are no match for an army of the Enlightened. These are glorious times! Lift up your head, friend, and shout with praise! }
{261}{}{我听说我们的讨伐进行得很顺利。我们在向北行进，就和主教向我们许诺的一样，黑暗的力量与光明的力量根本无法相比。这是伟大的时代！抬起你的头，朋友，喊出你的赞美吧！}

#{262}{}{And what happens to those we defeat? Can we dispel a Dark Age with blood? With tyranny? }
{262}{}{被我们打败的那些人会怎样呢？我们用血和暴行就能驱走黑暗吗？}

#{263}{}{Man, I wanna just start dancing! }
{263}{}{我现在好想跳舞呀！}

#{264}{}{Well I've heard all I need to know. }
{264}{}{很好，我已经听到了所有我需要知道的事情。}

#{265}{}{No thanks. I've got a sore throat. I'd rather celebrate in my own way - by killing you! }
{265}{}{不，谢了。我嗓子有点痛。我最好以我自己的方式来庆祝――杀了你！}

#{266}{}{I did not mean to insult you, nor to interfere in your duties. Please accept my apologies. May the Master bless you for your service. }
{266}{}{我并不是想要侮辱你，也并不想打扰你的工作。请接受我的道歉。愿主教因你的效忠而护佑你。}

#{267}{}{My apologies. Praise the Master, and have a nice day. }
{267}{}{我很抱歉。赞美主教，愿你一天愉快。}

#{268}{}{Yours is a sad soul, my friend. I can only guess what horrors you've seen that makes you close your mind. Open it now, and find peace. Watch the screens, listen to Father Morpheus, and praise the Master. }
{268}{}{你的灵魂非常悲伤，我的朋友。是什么样的恐怖令你的心灵关闭，我现在只能猜测。打开你的心灵吧，获得安宁。看看那些屏幕，听听墨菲斯神父的布道，赞美主教吧。}

#{269}{}{I know nothing, my friend, nothing! You shall have to find someone else to answer your inquiry. But it is not wise to ask about the Nightkin. }
{269}{}{我什么都不知道，我的朋友，什么都不知道！你应该去找其他的人来问你的问题。但不应该去问隐形人。}

#{270}{}{Sure. No problem. }
{270}{}{当然。没问题。}

#{271}{}{Why's that? }
{271}{}{为什么？}

#{272}{}{I only have one question about them. Do they scream real loud when you kill them? }
{272}{}{我只有一个问题要问他们。他们被杀死的时候惨叫声有多大？}

#{273}{}{You know nothing? You must be stupid? }
{273}{}{你什么都不知道？你是傻子吗？}

#{274}{}{Nightkin! Nightkin! Kill! }
{274}{}{隐形人！隐形人！杀呀！}

#{275}{}{This has been a wonderful talk, but I am falling behind in my praises. Farewell. Praise the Master! Praise the Holy Flame! Let us sing the sacred songs.. }
{275}{}{这次谈话非常有意义，但我的赞美已经落后于进度了。再见。赞美主教！赞美圣火！让我们来唱一些圣歌吧……}

#{276}{}{If you do not like it here, you can leave. Praise the Master, and have a nice day. }
{276}{}{如果你不喜欢这里，你尽可以离开。赞美主教，并祝你日安。}

#{277}{}{I pity the Wastes, if that is a sample of the warped humor it breeds. I would not share it with the others. }
{277}{}{如果那是废土上产生的幽默感的话，我为废土感到遗憾。我不会把这种幽默感和别人分享的。}

#{278}{}{Anyone in particular I should avoid? }
{278}{}{我应该特别避开哪些人？}

#{279}{}{This place must be no fun at all! }
{279}{}{这个地方一定没有任何乐趣！}

#{280}{}{Okay, I'll cut the jokes. }
{280}{}{好吧，我不再说笑话了。}

#{281}{}{Have you heard the one about the nuke jockey and the traveling salesman? }
{281}{}{你听说过关于核操作员和旅行推销员的事情吗？}

#{282}{}{Are you sure I can't show you what I do for laughs.. }
{282}{}{我不会拿你开玩笑的……}

#{283}{}{Not that I can think of. Farewell, friend. }
{283}{}{我不关心那个。再见，我的朋友。}

#{284}{}{I do not believe that I can help you, my friend. Farewell, and have a nice day. Praise the Master! Praise the Holy Flame.. }
{284}{}{我不认为我能帮助你，我的朋友。再见，祝你日安。赞美主教！赞美圣火……}

#{285}{}{I can't help you with that, I'm afraid. Well, I must meditate on the glories of the Master. Please excuse me. Hail the Master! Praise the Holy Flame! }
{285}{}{恐怕我不能帮助你。嗯，我现在必须冥想关于主教的光辉业绩了。请原谅。向主教致敬！赞美圣火！}

#{286}{}{Everyone here is filled with love! But it's hard for some people to express their love, and the Nightkin find it extremely hard to express it. But you shall discover this on your own. Praise the Master! Praise the Holy Flame! }
{286}{}{这里的每个人都充满了爱！但对于某些人来说，表达出爱是非常困难的，而隐形人表达爱是尤其困难的。但你应该自己去发现这些。赞美主教！赞美圣火！}

#{287}{}{We must submit to the Master and the Holy Flame. When we have proven ourselves, we shall become baptized and closer to God. When all have been baptized, we shall be as one, a Unity under the Master! }
{287}{}{我们必须把自己的一切献给主教和圣火。当我们证明了我们自己之后，我们将得到洗礼，更加接近神。当所有人都接受洗礼之后，我们将成为了一个人，主教的联合军！}

#{288}{}{Tell me more about this baptism. }
{288}{}{告诉我关于这个洗礼的事情。}

#{289}{}{What happens if someone doesn't want to be baptized? }
{289}{}{如果有人不想接受洗礼怎么办？}

#{290}{}{Sounds interesting. Mind if I look around a little more? }
{290}{}{听起来很有趣。我想在周围看看，你介意吗？}

#{291}{}{I think you're all a bunch of zombies. }
{291}{}{我认为你们不过是群没趣的僵尸。}

#{292}{}{There's only one Unity for mankind, and that's when we become wormfood. }
{292}{}{统一的可能性只有一种。而那是在我们都死了之后。}

#{293}{}{We have a right to survive. The ancients tried to survive and keep their freedom, and look at what they did to us! We must not make the same mistakes. Unity is the only solution. It's the only way to save what humanity has become! }
{293}{}{我们有生存下去的权利。古代人曾经试图自由的生存下去，你看看他们都对我们做了什么！我们不能犯和他们相同的错误。统一是唯一的方案。只有这样才能拯救现已变质的人性！}

#{294}{}{What do you mean what humanity has become? We're still perfectly human. }
{294}{}{你为什么认为人性已经变质了？我们可都还是完整的人类。}

#{295}{}{Perhaps the mistake our ancestors made wasn't lack of unity. Maybe they couldn't leave other people alone. }
{295}{}{我不认为我们祖先犯下的错误是因为没有统一。也许是因为他们不能容忍和他们不一样的人民。}

#{296}{}{I ain't no philosopher, but I know when something's right and something's wrong, and this is wrong. }
{296}{}{我并不是哲学家，但我能够分辨对错，而这件事是错误的。}

#{297}{}{Maybe you're right. }
{297}{}{也许你是对的。}

#{298}{}{Humanity ain't worth saving, and neither are you. Die, you little zombie! }
{298}{}{人性根本就不值得拯救，你也是一样。去死吧，僵尸！}

#{299}{}{The Master has said that it was lack of Unity, so it must have been. Seek his high priest! Father Morpheus will correct the lies you have been told. }
{299}{}{主教说那是因为缺少统一，因此一定就是那样。去找他的高级牧师！墨菲斯神父会纠正你所有错误的观念。}

#{300}{}{We're not zombies! When I was a member of the Fighting Flesh street gang, I was a psychotic fool who did anything that the higher-ups told me to do! Praise to the Master that I am no longer so blind! Oh, praise the Master! Let's praise him togeth#er, shall we? }
{300}{}{我们并不是僵尸！当我还是街头的帮派成员时，我只是一个神经不正常的蠢货，只会做上级让我做的事情！赞美主教，我现在已经不再那么愚蠢了！哦，赞美主教！让我们一起赞美他吧，好吗？}

#{301}{}{I could praise him better if I knew what he was doing. }
{301}{}{要是我知道他在做什么，我会更好的赞美他。}

#{302}{}{Praise the Master! }
{302}{}{赞美主教！}

#{303}{}{You praise the Master, I'm outta here. }
{303}{}{你赞美主教吧，我要走了。}

#{304}{}{How about praising him together over some holy wine. I need a drink! }
{304}{}{一边喝点圣酒一边赞美他如何？我需要喝酒！}

#{305}{}{I've got an even better idea. I'll praise him over your dead zombie corpse. Time to die! }
{305}{}{我有一个更好的主意。我会站在你这僵尸的尸体上赞美他。去死吧！}

#{306}{}{Isn't it wonderful that the Master would unite humans and mutants? He transcends hatred and prejudice. Can't you see, this proves that he wants what's best for everyone! }
{306}{}{主教将会统一人类与变种人，多么伟大啊！他将扫除所有的憎恨与偏见。难道你看不到吗？这证明了他是为了所有人的利益而着想！}

#{307}{}{I suppose the armies are sharing love and brotherhood everywhere they go.. }
{307}{}{我想，那些军队一定也在把爱和兄弟情谊带到他们走过的地方。}

#{308}{}{I guess he's not doing it because mutants are more effective killers. }
{308}{}{我不认为他在那样做，因为变种人杀戮起来更有效率。}

#{309}{}{Praise the Master! }
{309}{}{赞美主教！}

#{310}{}{I need more proof. }
{310}{}{我需要更多的证据。}

#{311}{}{How about praising him together over some holy wine. I need a drink! }
{311}{}{一边喝点圣酒一边赞美他如何？我需要喝酒！}

#{312}{}{I see it now. I'll follow the Master's example! I know what's best for you, therefore, I must kill you now! Makes perfect sense.. }
{312}{}{我现在明白了，我要跟随主教，以他为榜样！因此我知道怎么做才能对的起你，我必须杀了你！多么有意义啊……}

#{313}{}{Open your heart. Open your mind. Listen to what people are saying, and you will find enlightenment. }
{313}{}{打开你的心灵。敞开你的灵魂。听听所有的人在说些什么，你会找到欢乐的。}

#{314}{}{Perhaps there's someone who can explain things more directly. Is the Master available.. }
{314}{}{也许会有人可以更清楚的表达这一切。也许主教可以……}

#{315}{}{What I'm seeing are a bunch of zombies! }
{315}{}{我看到的只有一大堆的僵尸！}

#{316}{}{Those ain't reasons, Those are propaganda! }
{316}{}{这些并不是原因，这些只是传道而已！}

#{317}{}{I think I'll just walk around and see for myself. }
{317}{}{我想我还是该走了，自己来观察这一切。}

#{318}{}{I'd rather open a bottle of wine. Where is the booze around here? }
{318}{}{我想我最好还是来一瓶酒。这边哪里有酒宴？}

#{319}{}{You zombies make me sick! I want to kill each and every one of you! }
{319}{}{你们这些僵尸让我恶心！我要杀了你们所有的僵尸！}

#{320}{}{How sad. I will pray for you. }
{320}{}{多么悲哀啊。我会为你祈祷。}

#{321}{}{Unfortunately, I have never been privileged enough to see the baptismal font. Perhaps if I offer enough praise to the Master, I will receive a blessing. Hail the Master! Hail the Holy Flame! Hail Peace and Unity! }
{321}{}{很不幸，我现在都还没有看到过洗礼盘。也许我赞美主教还不够多，不足以得到他的祝福。向主教致敬！向圣火致敬！向和平和统一致敬！}

#{322}{}{Of course he won't. He's the Master. He would never do that to his disciples. It is his holy power through baptism, and the Holy Flame, that will transform us. The virus is an evil of the old time, which I'm sure will be cleansed. }
{322}{}{他当然不会。他是主教。他绝不会做违反他原则的事情。他的神圣力量散布于洗礼之中，而圣火将改变我们。病毒只是古代留下的恶魔，我确信它将会被消灭。}

#{323}{}{We have no desire to bring you distress. If we cannot comfort you, please find another place where you can deal with your torment. This is a place of peace. }
{323}{}{我们并不想让你失望。如果我们不能给你带来安慰，请去找另外的地方来解决折磨你的事情。这里是和平的圣地。}

#{324}{}{I'm outta here! }
{324}{}{我走了。}

#{325}{}{I told you to shut up. Why can't you listen? }
{325}{}{我告诉过你把嘴闭上。你为什么不听呢？}

#{326}{}{I guess the only way to get peace and quiet is to kill you all! Die!! }
{326}{}{我认为得到和平和安宁的唯一办法就是把你们都杀了！去死吧！}

#{327}{}{You will have to find the answer to that question yourself. Praise the Master! Praise the Holy Flame! }
{327}{}{你应当自己找到那个问题的答案。赞美主教！赞美圣火！}

#{328}{}{The baptism will change us all, and bring our physical forms closer to God's own image. When we have all become God, all our differences will disappear, so we can have peace and unity at last, and there will never be war or destruction again! }
{328}{}{洗礼将改变我们，把我们的身体改变为与神更相似的形态。当我们都成为神的时候，我们的差异将会完全消除，这样我们将会得到最终的和平和统一，从此将不会再有战争和破坏了！}

#{329}{}{And where is the baptismal font? }
{329}{}{那么洗礼用的圣盘在哪里？}

#{330}{}{That sounds like he's going to dump everybody in the FEV-2 Virus! }
{330}{}{那听起来似乎是说他要把所有人都扔进ＦＥＶ－２的大病毒槽里！}

#{331}{}{What a wonderful day that's going to be! }
{331}{}{那真是超级棒的一天！}

#{332}{}{Well I've heard all I need to know. }
{332}{}{很好，我已经听到了所有我需要知道的事情。}

#{333}{}{Then I better get in some destruction while I still have a chance. Die asshole! }
{333}{}{那么我最好在我还有机会的时候多做些毁灭。去死吧，蠢货！}

#{334}{}{Once people understand the Master and what he stands for, everyone will want to be baptized. The only people who would not wish to be baptized are the insane, and they should be put out of their misery for their own safety, poor wretched things. #}
{334}{}{当人们理解了主教所从事的事业时，所有人都会想要得到洗礼的。那些不愿意得到洗礼的人是疯狂的，为了他们自己的安全，他们必须终结自己悲惨的命运，可怜的人啊。}

#{335}{}{Aren't you surprised by the number of insane people you've encountered already? }
{335}{}{你难道不为你们现在遇到的“疯狂的”人的数量感到吃惊吗？}

#{336}{}{You're nuts! }
{336}{}{你们才是疯狂的！}

#{337}{}{I think I'd better look around a little more. }
{337}{}{我认为我最好还是在周围多转转。}

#{338}{}{Yeah. Poor wretched things. Let's break out the holy wine and drink to them! }
{338}{}{没错，可怜的人。让我们打开圣酒痛饮一番吧！}

#{339}{}{Hey, if you need anyone put out of their misery - or yours - I'm available! }
{339}{}{嘿，如果你需要人终结他们的悲惨命运――或是你的――我就可以呀！}

#{340}{}{Friend, if you look for the truth with an open mind, you will find us waiting for you. Praise the Master! I wish you well on your quest for enlightenment. }
{340}{}{朋友，如果你敞开心灵去寻找真理的话，你会发现我们在那里等着你。赞美主教！祝你在路上充满欢乐。}

#{341}{}{We must become closer to God, mutant and human alike. I'm not sure what the Master means with this particular part of the message, but it must be true. Praise the Master, he is so wise! }
{341}{}{我们必须更接近神，变种人和人类都是一样。我并不确定主教这句话到底是什么意思，但那一定是正确的。赞美主教，他是如此睿智！}

#{342}{}{But if he were truly wise, would his message have any ambiguity? }
{342}{}{但如果他真的很睿智的话，为什么他的话这么模棱两可呢？}

#{343}{}{You're nuts! }
{343}{}{你是个疯子！}

#{344}{}{I think I'd better look around a little more. }
{344}{}{我认为我最好还是在周围多转转。}

#{345}{}{Yeah. I've got a great idea! Let's break out the holy wine and drink a toast to the master's wisdom! }
{345}{}{没错。我有一个很好的主意！让我们打开圣酒，为主教的睿智而痛饮一番吧！}

#{346}{}{All the wisdom in the world won't help against a .56 caliber slug between the eyes. }
{346}{}{在这世界上，任何圣贤都敌不过一颗能射进两眼中间的．５６口径子弹！}

#{347}{}{We're forging a world that's better for everyone. That's all. I'm sorry if you don't understand yet. I pray that someone wiser than I can change your mind. Farewell, my friend. Praise the Master! Praise Peace and Unity! }
{347}{}{我们在为所有的人创造一个更好的世界。那就是全部。我很遗憾你并没有理解。我祈祷会有更智慧的人能够改变你的主意。再见，我的朋友。赞美主教！赞美和平与统一！}

#{348}{}{The world holds many surprises, my friend, some pleasant, some unpleasant. Farewell, my friend, and praise the Master! }
{348}{}{世界上有很多让人惊奇的事情，我的朋友，有些是愉快的，有些是不愉快的。再见，我的朋友，赞美主教！}
