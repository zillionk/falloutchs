# {104}{}{Sorry, I can't talk right now.}
# {105}{}{Vree's over there.}
# {106}{}{Now where did I put that file?}
# {107}{}{Where's that schematic?}
# {108}{}{Well, the computer says it should work. Now what did I do wrong?}

{101}{}{我喜欢这个新设计原型的研制工作。}
{102}{}{现在我们物资紧缺，也只能有什么就用什么了。}
{103}{}{我不明白我的最终设计原型为什么不能工作。}
{104}{}{抱歉，我现在没空说话。}
{105}{}{弗蕾就在那里。}
{106}{}{现在我把这文件放在哪里？}
{107}{}{那个摘要在哪里？}
