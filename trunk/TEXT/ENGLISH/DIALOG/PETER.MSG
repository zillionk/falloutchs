#{100}{}{You see Peter, leader of the Follower Scouts.}
#{101}{}{What are you doing around here? Can't you see we are busy?}
#{102}{}{Huh?}
#{103}{}{I am sorry. I will go now.}
#{104}{}{Can I help you with anything?}
#{105}{}{Who can I talk to about giving my assistance.}
#{106}{}{Great. I'm busy, and I get a moron tailing me. Go look for Jake
# if you need someone to talk to.}
#{107}{}{Sure. You can start by getting out of my way.}
#{108}{}{Certainly. Anything else?}
#{109}{}{There must be something more I can do.}
#{110}{}{Do not throw me to the side.}
#{111}{}{Yes. You can get out of here.}
#{112}{}{Fine. It doesn't look like I will get rid of you any other way.
# It seems that we are having a security problem. You want to help, you
# find the problem.}
#{113}{}{Okay. Will do.}
#{114}{}{Forget it!}
#{115}{}{Fine. Get out then!}
#{116}{}{Look, we have a breach in security. We need to find this breach and end it.}
#{117}{}{Ok. Will do.}
#{118}{}{Forget it!}
#{119}{}{Do I look like a guide. Go talk to Jake if you are looking for a guide.}
#{120}{}{Leave. i am trying to finish up a little work.}
#{121}{}{We need that spy gone. Hurry up!}
#{122}{}{Good job on taking out Heather. I should have known it was her.
# She always seemed to disappear in the raids. Here, take this and go.}

{100}{}{你看到皮得，“启示录”预言派的头领。}
{101}{}{你在这干什么呢？没看见我们正忙着呢吗？}
{102}{}{啊？}
{103}{}{抱歉。我这就走。}
{104}{}{我能帮你什么吗？}
{105}{}{关于给我协助的事，我该跟谁谈？}
{106}{}{真是太“棒”了。我这么忙，却还有个低能佬跟着我。你要想找人说话就找杰克去。}
{107}{}{当然了。你可以先滚开，其他的都好说。}
{108}{}{当然。还有别的事吗？}
{109}{}{肯定还有其他什么事是我可以做的。}
{110}{}{别不搭理我。}
{111}{}{是的。你可以离开了。}
{112}{}{好吧好吧。看来我怎样也甩不掉你。那警卫们有活干了。你这么寻求帮助只会给自己惹麻烦。}
{113}{}{好吧。就这样吧。}
{114}{}{算了。}
{115}{}{好。那就给我撒腿跑！}
{116}{}{瞧，是这样的，我们的保全系统里出现了点麻烦，得找出这个麻烦然后解决掉它。懂吗？}
{117}{}{好。就这样。}
{118}{}{算了。}
{119}{}{我看起来象个导游吗？想要导游找杰克去。}
{120}{}{走开。我正努力完成这工作。}
{121}{}{我们要除掉那个二五仔。要快。}
{122}{}{除掉希瑟那件事，你干的不错。我早该知道是她。她总是行踪不定，走到歹徒那边就不见。给，拿了这个走吧。}
