{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see a super mutant. He is guarding the airlock door.}
#{101}{}{You see a super mutant guard.}
#{102}{}{耶利米, you may pass.}
#{103}{}{Move along.}
#{104}{}{Move faster, messenger.}
#{105}{}{Normals cannot carry weapons here! Halt and identify yourself!}
#{106}{}{Grrr!}
#{107}{}{Uh, sorry. I'll put it away.}
#{108}{}{I'm just passing through. No need for identities here.}
#{109}{}{Die! Die! Die! I always wanted to say that.}
#{110}{}{I will not be spoken to that way. You will be punished.}
#{111}{}{Halt! What is your business here, 'child'.}
#{112}{}{Hng!}
#{113}{}{I'm, uh, doing stuff.}
#{114}{}{I'm on important business. You have no right to stop and question me.}
#{115}{}{Don't talk to me, big boy.}
# {116}{}{Your answer does not settle my nerves. Speak quickly and clearly, or
 # I will assume you are here for foul purposes. I assure you that you will
 # not like that...}
#{117}{}{Uh, no, really, honestly. I'm doing stuff.}
#{118}{}{I'm bringing a message to our leader.}
#{119}{}{I sense the untruth behind your words. You will not be allowed in. This I promise you...}
#{120}{}{You may pass, but next time, follow the proper procedure...}
#{121}{}{Ok, thanks. See you around.}
#{122}{}{And what's that?}
#{123}{}{Blessing to you, brother.}
#{124}{}{A true follower of the Master would have that knowledge. You are an intruder!}
#{125}{}{Move along. I don't have time for your questions.}
#{126}{}{You are annoying me.}
#{127}{}{I have work to do. Do you?}
#{128}{}{You are making a mistake by coming here. Explain yourself or perish...}
#{129}{}{Nuggie!}
#{130}{}{I have nothing to say.}
#{131}{}{I'm here to protect humanity from the likes of you.}
#{132}{}{Oh, shut up!}
#{133}{}{You should not try to fool me by playing dumb. I tire of this...}
#{134}{}{What kind of foolish bigotry is that, we are 'humanity.' We're just as human as you are.}
#{135}{}{What kind of crap is that?}
#{136}{}{There is no possible way that you are human.}
#{137}{}{My name is 凯尔. I was born to a mother and a father, like yourself.
# The Master just oversaw my rebirth. These muscles, this skin, this strength
# does not make me any less human than you. I do not like all that the Unity
# stands for, but it is the best chance for peace that we have.}
#{138}{}{Not on my watch, it isn't. I'm here to put an end to you and your kind.}
#{139}{}{You may be human, but that still doesn't make your Unity right. I guess we will be enemies.}
#{140}{}{It is a pity that you act this way, but you will not proceed further...}
#{141}{}{It will be a true shame to see your head on a pike.}
#{142}{}{Intruders!}
#{143}{}{I no speak to you.}
#{200}{}{You gain }
#{201}{}{ experience points for bluffing your way past the guards.}

{100}{}{你看见一个超级变种人。他看守着气闸室的门。}
{101}{}{你看见一个超级变种人卫兵。}
{102}{}{耶利米，你可以通过。}
{103}{}{往前走。}
{104}{}{快点走，传信的。}
{105}{}{普通人类不能在这里携带武器！不许动，报上你的身份！}
{106}{}{呃!}
{107}{}{嗯，对不起。我会把它放好的。}
{108}{}{我只是通过这儿，没必要通报身份。}
{109}{}{我老想说这句，‘死！死！死！’}
{110}{}{你敬酒不吃吃罚酒。}
{111}{}{停下！小鬼，你来这儿干啥？}
{112}{}{嗯!}
{113}{}{我啊，嗯, 做事。}
{114}{}{我很重要任务。你没权拦下问我。}
{115}{}{别和我说话，大家伙。}
{116}{}{你那些话骗不过我。快点老实说，否则我就认定个不怀好意。我保证你不会喜欢那样……}
{117}{}{嗯，不，真的，没撒谎，我就是来做事的。}
{118}{}{我给我们的领袖传信来得。}
{119}{}{我觉得你话里有鬼。我肯定你不准进去。}
{120}{}{你可以通过，不过下次，要遵守正式规定……}
{121}{}{好，谢谢。待会儿见。}
{122}{}{又有什么事？}
{123}{}{祝福你，兄弟。}
{124}{}{真正跟随大主教的人都应该清楚这些。你是个奸细！}
{125}{}{往前走。我没空回答你的问题。}
{126}{}{你很烦人啊。}
{127}{}{我有工作要做。你呢？}
{128}{}{你到这儿可来错了。不说清楚就是死……}
{129}{}{噗嗤!}
{130}{}{我没有什么好说的。}
{131}{}{我来这就是为了从你们这些家伙手里拯救人类。}
{132}{}{哦，闭嘴！}
{133}{}{你别装疯卖傻来骗我。我可烦了……}
{134}{}{看，这样多傻多固执，我们都是“人类”。我们和你们都是一样的人。}
{135}{}{这是什么垃圾？}
{136}{}{你不可能是人类。}
{137}{}{我的名字是凯尔。我也和你们一样，是父母生的。主教监督了我重生的过程。这肌肉、这皮肤、还有这力量可不让我比你们这种人差。虽然我不喜欢融合表现出的所有那些东西，但这是我们和平共处的最好办法。}
{138}{}{就我的观察，这可是错误的. 我来这就是为了消灭你和你这类人的。}
{139}{}{也许你算人类，但是这并不代表着你们融合就是对的。我想我们会是敌人。}
{140}{}{很遗憾你走上这条路，不过你不会再走下去了……}
{141}{}{看到你的脑袋插在矛上真是遗憾。}
{142}{}{有人闯进来了！}
{143}{}{我不和你说。}
{200}{}{通过蒙骗守卫获得通行，你获得}
{201}{}{点经验值。}
