#{100}{}{You see Sherry.}
{100}{}{你看到雪莉。}

#{101}{}{You see a gang member.}
{101}{}{你看到一个帮派成员。}

#{102}{}{}
{102}{}{}

#{103}{}{Who are you and what are you doing here?}
{103}{}{你是谁？你要干什么？}

#{104}{}{I'm }
{104}{}{我是}

#{105}{}{. I'm new to this town.}
{105}{}{。我是刚刚来到这个城镇的。}

#{106}{}{None of your business, wench!}
{106}{}{不关你的事，你这村姑！}

#{107}{}{Puwah?}
{107}{}{噗哇？}

#{108}{}{Apparently so, since everyone knows that this is the territory
# of the Skulz. You'd better beat it before someone decides to hurt you.}
{108}{}{显然是这样，因为每个人都知道这里是属于斯库兹帮的地盘。你得先了解这一点，否则会有人来揍你的。}

#{109}{}{Bring it on!}
{109}{}{让他们来吧！}

#{110}{}{Sorry, I thought this was the bathroom. Bye.}
{110}{}{对不起，我以为这里是洗手间呢。再见。}

#{111}{}{The Skulz? Who're they?}
{111}{}{斯库兹帮？他们是干吗的？}

#{112}{}{Yeah, I knew that. I'm just hangin' out.}
{112}{}{是啊，我知道，我是特意来这里看看的。}

#{113}{}{Take off, you hoser, before one of us decides to tear you up.}
{113}{}{在我们的人把你打个结扔出去之前快滚，你这废物。}

#{114}{}{Sheesh, sorry.}
{114}{}{嘘，对不起。}

#{115}{}{Yeah? Bring it on!}
{115}{}{是吗？放马过来吧！}

#{116}{}{You sorry thing. You should run along. It's not safe here,
# especially for someone like you who wouldn't understand.}
{116}{}{你这可怜的东西。你早该跑掉的。这里很不安全，尤其是对于你这种什么都不懂的人来说。}

#{117}{}{That's us! We're the meanest gang in town. Actually, we're the only gang.
# But nobody messes with us.}
{117}{}{那就是我们！我们是这个城镇中最强大的帮派。事实上我们是唯一的帮派。不过没有人敢找我们的麻烦。}

#{118}{}{So you pretty much have the run of the town, eh?}
{118}{}{因此你们在很大程度上拥有城镇的控制权，对吗？}

#{119}{}{How nice. See ya.}
{119}{}{听起来不错。再见。}

#{120}{}{Oh. Well, you'd better not. I mean, you're not one of the Skulz,
# and this is our place. So, you should get lost, before Victor gets itchy.}
{120}{}{哦，好吧，你最好不。我是说，你并不是斯库兹帮的一员，而这里是我们的地盘。所以，你最好在维克托发怒之前赶快离开。}

#{121}{}{Actually, I think I'll stay.}
{121}{}{事实上，我想要待在这里。}

#{122}{}{Who's Victor?}
{122}{}{维克托是谁？}

#{123}{}{Fine, I'm out of here.}
{123}{}{很好，我会走的。}

#{124}{}{Fine. It's your funeral.}
{124}{}{很好，准备你的葬礼吧。}

#{125}{}{Victor's right over there. He's the meanest of us all. He likes torturing
# iguanas that he catches. I don't really like him, to tell the truth, but he's one
# of us.}
{125}{}{维克托就在那边。他是我们中最强的一个。他喜欢折磨他抓住的蜥蜴。说实话，我并不真正喜欢他，但他是我们中的一员。}

#{126}{}{Well, there's Victor, and Shark, who hangs out at the Skum Pitt. Vinnie, too,
# and a couple other guys who stop by from time to time.}
{126}{}{嗯，维克托和沙克呆在萨姆・匹特那，还有维尼。另外两个人也会经常过来。}

#{127}{}{Where's the Skum Pitt?}
{127}{}{萨姆・匹特在哪？}

#{128}{}{Oh, the Skum Pitt is a sleazy bar north of here, near Gizmo's casino.}
{128}{}{哦，萨姆・匹特是北边的一个小酒吧，在吉斯莫的赌场旁边。}

#{129}{}{You bet! Nobody messes with us! Well, except for Killian, but he's cool
# and all. He's like the sheriff man. We do whatever we want.}
{129}{}{你说对了！没有人找我们的麻烦！不过，基利安倒是常常和我们作对，不过他很酷。他那个人就像治安官一样。我们可以做任何想做的事。}

#{130}{}{We just hang out, and sometimes we play games at Gizmo's or have some
# fun over at the Skum Pitt. Sometimes we do odd jobs for Gizmo or for some
# traveler. Victor likes stalking people, too. Come to think of it, you might
# want to stay away from him.}
{130}{}{我们只是呆在这里，有时候会到吉斯莫那里玩玩，或者在萨姆・匹特那里找找乐子。有的时候我们也为吉斯莫或某些履行着做些奇怪的任务。维克托也喜欢抓人。如果你好好想想的话，你还是应该离他远一点。}

#{131}{}{You work for Gizmo? What can you tell me about him?}
{131}{}{你为吉斯莫工作？关于他你能告诉我什么？}

#{132}{}{So what is it that you guys do?}
{132}{}{那你们到底是做什么的呢？}

#{133}{}{Who all is in the gang?}
{133}{}{这个帮派的成员究竟有哪些？}

#{134}{}{Why do you hang out with these guys?}
{134}{}{为什么你不和那些人在一起呢？}

#{135}{}{We're like a family! We take care of each other. Well, except for Shark,
# who's always breaking things. And Victor, who looks at people funny. But
# Vinnie is cool. And we do stuff together. You know, we're like friends and stuff.}
{135}{}{我们就像一个家庭一样！我们相互照顾。嗯，也许除了沙克，他总是打碎东西。还有维克托，他看人的样子太好笑了。但维尼很酷。我们一起做事。你知道，我们就像朋友和同事一样。}

#{136}{}{Oh, it's you again! You know, it's probably not healthy to hang out here
# if you're not one of the Skulz. And you're not.}
{136}{}{哦，又是你！你知道，如果你不是斯库兹帮的一员，呆在这里很可能不利于你的健康――而你的确不是。}

#{137}{}{Yeah, well, your Skulz probably couldn't knock over a sleeping Brahmin,
# much less take on me.}
{137}{}{是啊，你们斯库兹帮能做的事情只有骚扰睡着了的双头牛而已，我才不怕你们呢。}

#{138}{}{What have you been up to lately?}
{138}{}{你们最近在做什么呢？}

#{139}{}{Really? We'll see about that! Victor!}
{139}{}{真的吗？让我们试试看！维克托！}

#{140}{}{Not too much, actually. There's not much to do. I mean, Shark has been
# causing some fights at the Skum Pitt, as usual, but what else is there to
# do around here?}
{140}{}{事实上没有什么事情。一直都没有什么事可做。我的意思是，沙克仍然和平时一样在萨姆・匹特打几场架，但除此之外在这附近有什么事情可做呢？}

#{141}{}{Uh, not much, I guess.}
{141}{}{呃，我想的确没什么事情可做。}

#{142}{}{You could always try doing something else. You must have some talents
# or hobbies.}
{142}{}{你应该可以尝试做些其它的事情。你一定有某方面的天分或是爱好。}

#{143}{}{Well, I do sort of like to draw. And Vinnie says I'm a pretty good cook.
# But I mean, hey, we have fun and stuff, you know?}
{143}{}{嗯，我的确比较喜欢画画。还有维尼说我是个很好的厨师。拥有事业还有很多业余爱好真是件好事，你知道吗？}

#{144}{}{I guess that's understandable.}
{144}{}{我想那是可以理解的。}

#{145}{}{But what will you do when you get older? Where will your life go?
# How will you make money?}
{145}{}{但你老了之后该怎么办呢？你的生活将去向何方？你将如何赚钱？}

#{146}{}{Um, well, I never gave it much thought. I mean, Vinnie and Victor make
# some money and Shark occasionally does some bodyguarding for visitors here.
# I don't know.}
{146}{}{唉，说起来我的确没有想过这些。维尼和维克托能赚到一些钱，沙克也经常为来这里的游客当保镖。我不知道。}

#{147}{}{You should probably get out while you still can.}
{147}{}{你应该趁着还年轻还有希望的时候跳出这种无聊的生活。}

#{148}{}{Hey, lay off! You sound like Vinnie's parents used to. We all support
# each other, okay? So back off.}
{148}{}{嘿，你得了吧！你的话听起来就像维尼的父母以前经常说的那些。我们相互支持，你知道吗？所以请离开。}

#{149}{}{I guess. I never thought about it much.}
{149}{}{我想也是。我真的没有想过那么多。}

#{150}{}{Hi! How are you doing? It's been a while.}
{150}{}{嗨！你怎么样？好久没见了。}

#{151}{}{I'm all right, thanks.}
{151}{}{我很好，谢谢。}

#{152}{}{I've been better.}
{152}{}{我比以前还好。}

#{153}{}{Okay. How about you?}
{153}{}{还行。你呢？}

#{154}{}{I'm sorry to hear that! Perhaps you should get a room and sleep it off.
# Talk to Marcelles. Oh, and here, I can fix you something to eat, if you like.}
{154}{}{听到这个消息我很抱歉！也许你需要一个房间好好睡一觉。去和玛塞尔谈，哦，如果你想要的话，我可以给你做点东西吃。}

#{155}{}{That would be swell, thanks.}
{155}{}{那太好了，谢谢。}

#{156}{}{No thanks, but I'll see you around.}
{156}{}{不用了，谢谢，一会再见。}

#{157}{}{Oh, I'm doing much better, thanks! I do some cooking now at the Skum Pitt
# and the Crash House. It gets kind of tiresome on some nights, but I do like to
# cook, and I get to meet all sorts of interesting people. And I get paid, too.
# Thanks for your help.}
{157}{}{哦！我可比以前强多了，谢谢你！我现在萨姆・匹特和倒塌的国会当了厨师。有些时候晚上的确很累，但我真的很喜欢烹饪，而且我还见到了各种各样有趣的人。我还赚到了钱。谢谢你的帮助。}

#{158}{}{There you go. Enjoy. And I'll see you around!}
{158}{}{那你走吧。祝你愉快，我会等着你再来的！}

#{159}{}{He's this huge fat guy who runs the Casino. He wants to run Junktown,
# but Killian keeps him in line. He pays pretty well, though. Occasionally he
# hires Vinnie or Victor to deal with people for him, if they've been a
# problem, like one stranger who showed up here a few weeks ago.}
{159}{}{他是赌场的老板，一个又高又胖的家伙。他想要统治垃圾城，但基利安把他控制住了。不过他付的报酬不少。他经常雇用维尼和维克托来收拾那些找麻烦的人，就好像几周前来这里的那家伙。}

#{160}{}{You want me to turn in my friends?!?}
{160}{}{你想让我告发我的朋友？！？}

#{161}{}{Yes, I need your information.}
{161}{}{是的，我需要你提供信息。}

#{162}{}{Sorry. Forget I asked.}
{162}{}{对不起。忘了我说的话吧。}

#{163}{}{They have been hurting people, and they will go on hurting people unless
# they're stopped. You changed your life for the better. Now you have a chance
# to help improve the lives of others, too.}
{163}{}{他们一直在伤害别人，而且除非他们被阻止，他们仍将继续伤害更多的人。你已经改变了你自己，过上了更好的生活。现在你有一个机会，让他们也可以过上更好的生活。}

#{164}{}{Hmm. Well, I mean, they are my friends. But I guess that they shouldn't
# be allowed to hurt people the way they do. And I guess I trust you since you
# helped me. All right.}
{164}{}{嗯。他们是我的朋友。但我想他们不应该像现在这样伤害别人。因为你帮助了我，我想应该信任你。好吧。}

#{165}{}{No, I can't do that! Those are my friends! I may not be a Skul anymore,
# but I'm not going to turn my back on my old friends.}
{165}{}{不，我不能那样做！他们是我的朋友！我可能不再是一名斯库兹帮的成员，但我是不会忘记老朋友的。}

#{166}{}{I need your help. I need your testimony to put away the Skulz for good.}
{166}{}{我需要你的帮助。为了大家的好处，我需要你的证言把斯库兹帮抓起来。}
