#{103}{}{What, did you spend all your money on drugs? If you keep that up you'll find your new home in old town

{103}{}{什么，你把钱都花在毒品上了？如果你再这样，你总有一天会烂在一堆瘾君子里的。}

#{115}{}{Sorry, we're not hiring.}
{115}{}{抱歉，我们人员满了。}

#{116}{}{You've got a lot of nerve showing your face here again.  I think you should leave.}
{116}{}{你还真敢露面啊。赶紧给我走！}

#{117}{}{I said beat it!}
{117}{}{我说了，滚！}

#{118}{}{What do you want?  Hiring you was a disaster.}
{118}{}{你还想干什么？雇你是一种灾难。}

#{119}{}{Please give me another chance!  I had no choice!}

#{133}{}{What?  After you abandoned that last job?  You're lucky they survived.}
{133}{}{什么？你上次擅离职守，还想要工作？算你走运，商队没事，要不然我宰了你！}

#{134}{}{I'm lucky?  You're lucky I don't pound your face in!}
{134}{}{我幸运？你才幸运呢，我没有把你的脸砸烂。}

#{135}{}{Hey!  I had places to go and people to see.}

#{143}{}{You sicko. Go back to the pens.}
{143}{}{精神病啊！回你的疯人院去！}

#{144}{}{Seemed okay? You never leave a caravan, not even if it's a mile from its rendezvous. You were
# hired to guard it for the entire trip, otherwise we would have gotten someone else.}
{144}{}{大家没事？你不能离开商队！哪怕是距离集合点只有一里都不行。我们雇你是为了全程保护商队，要不然我们也用不着你了。}

#{145}{}{Well, no one told me I couldn't leave!}
{145}{}{哎，没人说我不能离开那。}

#{146}{}{I'm sorry, it will never happen again.}
{146}{}{对不起了，我保证以后不再犯。}

#{147}{}{Up yours.}
{147}{}{闭嘴。}

#{148}{}{What?  Is this your first caravan?  How did you get hired? This is a very delicate and important job;
# it's to be taken seriously. Lives are at stake, both the caravan and the towns we supply.}
{148}{}{什么？这是你第一次参加商队？你是怎么被挑中的？这是一个很重要也很难做的工作，你必须要认认真真的。你的行为会影响到商队和我们要补给的城市的存亡。}

#{149}{}{And you must be so proud of yourself.}
{149}{}{你肯定很自豪了。}

#{150}{}{What?  Do you want a medal or something?}
{150}{}{什么？你还想要个勋章还是什么的？}

#{151}{}{Let me save lives, please! I want to help!}
{151}{}{让我去拯救他们，拜托啦！我想帮忙啊！}

#{152}{}{I hope so!  This is a very delicate and important job; it's to be taken seriously. Lives are at
# stake! The caravans and the towns we supply depend on us!}
{152}{}{但愿如此，这是一个很重要也很难做的工作，你必须要认认真真的。你的行为会影响到商队和我们要补给的城市的存亡。}

#{153}{}{You must be so proud of yourself.}
{153}{}{你肯定很自豪了。}

#{154}{}{What?  Do you want a medal or something?}
{154}{}{什么？你还想要个勋章还是什么的？}

#{155}{}{Let me save lives, please!  I want to help!}
{155}{}{让我去拯救他们，拜托啦！我想帮忙啊！}

#{156}{}{Of course I am.}
{156}{}{当然了。}

{157}{}{那么，我还能再要这个工作吗？}

#{158}{}{You're an idiot!}
{158}{}{你是个白痴！}

#{159}{}{I've got to go.  Bye.}

#{161}{}{Get a life! }
{161}{}{你真他妈的高尚哦！}

#{162}{}{Oh?  And what about all the less fortunate people right under your nose?}
{162}{}{哦？那么你眼皮底下这些受苦的人呢？}

#{163}{}{You're right.  Can I have another job or what?}
{163}{}{你说的对，你给不给我这个工作啊？}

#{164}{}{What?  I don't know what you're talking about! Oh, you mean the skags?  They don't count.  They choose
# to live that way.}
{164}{}{什么？我不知道你要说什么？你说这些瘾君子？他们不算。他们自己选择那样过活的。}

#{165}{}{I guess you're right.}
{165}{}{我想你是对的。}

#{166}{}{You make me sick.}
{166}{}{你真虚伪。}

#{171}{}{I'm out of here.}
{171}{}{我受不了了。}

#{172}{}{That's the attitude!  To bad I can't give you another job.}
{172}{}{态度太那娘的差了！我不能给你这个工作。}

#{173}{}{What? After all that?  Oh come on!  Please can I have another job?}
{173}{}{什么？这么多废话就……别啊，我想要这个工作哇。}

#{174}{}{Well, back to saving the world then.}
{174}{}{好吧，回来拯救世界吧。}

#{175}{}{That's just fine. But don't ever expect to work for us again!}
{175}{}{你能这样想很好，不过我们不能再给你机会了。}

#{176}{}{Oh, please!  It will never happen again!}
{176}{}{拜托！我保证不会再出事的！}

#{177}{}{Like I'd want to!}

#{229}{}{Why, hello.  I understand you are looking for a job.  I'm surprised Rutger hired you, but I'm sure he

# places we go to on a regular basis: the Brotherhood of Steel, Junktown, and the Boneyard. The pay is
# always 400 scripts, and that's one way.  You can come back with the caravan for another 400 scripts.}
{229}{}{嗨，你好。我知道你在找工作。我很奇怪罗格尔会挑上你，但是我相信他有自己的道理。我们商队每月出行三次，8号，18号和28号。通常的路线是三条：钢铁兄弟会、迦克镇和晒骨场。工资一样，都是400个瓶盖，单程。你可以保护商队回程，那样又是400个瓶盖。}
