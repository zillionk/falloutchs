{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see Gwen, a desert bandit.}
#{101}{}{I am Gwen. I'm one of Garl's advisors. Who are you?}
#{102}{}{I'm }
#{103}{}{. What do you do around here?}
#{104}{}{I'm nobody special. Can you tell me about your camp?}
#{105}{}{Hroo?}
#{106}{}{I am the one who will sweep you off your feet, honey.}
#{107}{}{As an advisor, I make sure that no low-lifes
# cause any trouble for Garl.}
#{108}{}{And how do you do that?}
#{109}{}{You and what army?}
#{110}{}{I doubt you could do anything to stop anyone.}
#{111}{}{Looks like all the low-lifes live here.}
#{112}{}{Hmpf. If you're nobody special then I won't bother
# talking to you. Go away.}
#{113}{}{I keep idiots like you from bothering Garl.  Go away!}
#{114}{}{I have ways to make certain undesirables are no longer here.}
#{115}{}{I can see that I was wrong. You probably could do your
# job well. Good bye.}
#{116}{}{Prove it!}
#{117}{}{Die!}
#{118}{}{It's been so long since I've had a good fight. Too bad
# you are going to lose. Here is proof of my skills!}
#{119}{}{You'll regret that remark.  It will be your last!}
#{120}{}{If that is the best you can do, then I will be doing the
# world a favor by killing you.}
#{121}{}{Me and this army!}
#{122}{}{You annoy me. Leave before I become truly angry.}
{100}{}{你看见格温，一个沙漠强盗。}
{101}{}{我是格温。我是伽尔的顾问。你是谁？}
{102}{}{我是}
{103}{}{。你在这周围干什么？}
{104}{}{我没什么特别的。你能告诉我关于你的宿营地吗？}
{105}{}{呼？}
{106}{}{我就是那个为你服务的人，宝贝。}
{107}{}{作为一个顾问，我确保没有任何低等生命可以给伽尔制造麻烦。}
{108}{}{还有这关你事吗？}
{109}{}{你和什么军队？}
{110}{}{我怀疑你做不了什么去阻止别人。}
{111}{}{看起来所有低等生物都生活在这里。}
{112}{}{没什么特殊事情的话别来烦我，走开。}
{113}{}{我不能让你这样的白痴打扰伽尔。滚开！}
{114}{}{我有办法让那些不上路的家伙消失掉。}
{115}{}{我以前是错的。你可以把事情做好。再见。}
{116}{}{证明它！}
{117}{}{死！}
{118}{}{好久没有好好干一架了。认输吧，看我的厉害！}
{119}{}{你会为你的话后悔的。这是你最后的遗言了！}
{120}{}{如果你尽了全力才做到这些，我会代表全世界高兴的宰了你。}
{121}{}{我和这支军队！}
{122}{}{你惹恼我了。在我发作前快滚。}
