{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see Deputy Fry.}
#{101}{}{Ive been hoping to run into you, child killer. I hope your stay isnt long. Ill be playing close attention to you while youre here. Keep your nose clean in my city, Im just dying for an excuse to get rid of scum like you.}
#{102}{}{Hello friend, Deputy Tony Fry at your service.}
#{103}{}{What is this place?}
#{104}{}{Nice to meet you. Bye.}
#{105}{}{Wug.}
#{106}{}{Ack!}
#{107}{}{Oh, a newcomer! Welcome to the Hub! You've reached the biggest city on the coast. Heck, maybe the biggest city in the world for all we know. I thought you were part of the caravan, did you come in with them?}
#{108}{}{Yes.}
#{109}{}{No.}
#{110}{}{Im not surprised. Most of the new members of our city come in with the caravans, even with the missing caravans weve had. Its a fine city but be careful who you associate with. People like Decker and his thugs can get you into a lot of trouble.}
#{111}{}{Thats surprising. Its been pretty rough out there, especially with the missing caravans. But youre safe now, just stay away from the Maltese Falcon. They're a bunch of trouble makers, Decker and his crew.}
#{112}{}{Who's Decker?}
#{113}{}{Yeah, well . . . I'm pretty rough.}
#{114}{}{What was that about missing caravans?}
#{115}{}{Where can I make some money?}
#{116}{}{That's it, thanks.}
#{117}{}{If you say so. So, did you have any other questions?}
#{118}{}{Its a tragedy really. Some caravans have turned up missing. Butch over at the Far Go Traders is offering a reward for information or something. You should check at the merchant market if youre interested.}
#{119}{}{He owns the Maltese Falcon in the merchant market, but I wouldn associate with him if you want to stay out of trouble. He nothing but a murdering animal, but the Sheriff wont let me arrest him without proof.}
#{120}{}{No problem. Believe it or not, our city is quite safe and our police are all very highly trained peace keepers. You shouldnt have any problems, just avoid the Maltese Falcon.}
#{121}{}{Im sorry, I dont understand. Maybe you need healing? The Children of the Cathedral are south. Head straight down past the Merchant Market down to the Water Merchants. Theyre right next to the Water Merchants.}
#{122}{}{I'm still watching you, child killer.}
#{123}{}{Murdering animal!}
#{124}{}{I can't believe the Sheriff's dead . . .}
#{125}{}{There you are, you thieving little snake! I almost didnt recognize you. Guards!}
#{126}{}{Sure.}
#{127}{}{Catch me if you can.}
#{128}{}{No.}
#{129}{}{ARG!}
#{130}{}{Hello again. I hope you like our town. A nice young man such as yourself, is always welcome. If you should decide to stay, Im sure you would make a valuable addition to the Hub.}
#{131}{}{Hello again. I hope you like our town. A lovely lady such as yourself, is always welcome. If you should decide to stay, Im sure you would make a valuable addition to the Hub.}
#{132}{}{Hello again. What can I do for you?}
#{133}{}{Yes? I don't have all day. I'm trying to watch the front gate.}
#{134}{}{I have a crime to report!}
#{135}{}{Do you have a hospital, I'm injured.}
#{136}{}{Where are the shops?}
#{137}{}{Where's there work around here?}
#{138}{}{Bye.}
#{139}{}{Garro?}
#{140}{}{Ooga.}
#{141}{}{Really? I, uh, you should talk to the Sheriff. I cant leave my post right now. Ive got to . . . uh, fend off any raiders that might come. Plus, Im not very good with reports.}
#{142}{}{Oh, sorry. I hadnt noticed. The Children run the Hospital next to the Water Merchants. Go south past the Merchant market and youll see it just northwest of the Water Merchants. I hope everything goes okay.}
#{143}{}{Thats hard to miss. Its by far the busiest part of town. The Merchant Market is a few miles south of here. Youll be most interested in the northern section, thats where most of our locals buy and sell to the public.}
#{144}{}{Why that would be in the Merchant Market, a few miles south of here. Two of the caravan houses are located there, the third is further south. Id recommend the Far Go Traders. They pay well and they're not too crazy.}
#{145}{}{Dead?theyre all dead . . .}
#{146}{}{Pfffftttt . . . Chrrrr . . .}
#{147}{}{Do you know where I could find a Water Chip? My vault's chip malfunctioned, and we need another immediately.}
#{148}{}{Water Chip? Well, I've never heard of one. If it has to do with water, though, you should talk to the Water Merchants. Their headquarters are located further south, past the Downtown area.}

{100}{}{你看到代理警长佛莱。}
{101}{}{我希望你不要在这里久留，你杀过孩子吧？我会加倍留意你，在这里你最好收敛点，我很想找借口除掉你这样的人渣。}
{102}{}{你好，朋友。代理警长托尼・佛莱愿为您效劳。}
{103}{}{这是什么地方？}
{104}{}{很高兴见到你。再见。}
{105}{}{我靠。}
{106}{}{啊卡！}
{107}{}{噢，新来的！欢迎来到哈勃城! 你已经来到沿海最大的城市，不幸的是，据我所知，这里也许就是唯一幸存的大城市了。你是商队的吧？你的同伴呢？}
{108}{}{是的。}
{109}{}{不。}
{110}{}{我一点都不奇怪。我们的城市大部分新人都是和商队一起过来的，而且好多商队还失踪了，这是一个不错的城市，但是你要小心和谁结盟。德克和他的那伙人会给你带来很多的麻烦。}
{111}{}{真让人吃惊，外面歹徒太多了，特别是那些失踪的商队。还好你是安全的。别接近马耳他猎鹰。德克和他的手下是一帮制造麻烦的家伙。}
{112}{}{谁是德克？}
{113}{}{是的……我也是个流氓。}
{114}{}{商队为什么会失踪？}
{115}{}{我能在哪里赚些钱？}
{116}{}{好吧，谢谢。}
{117}{}{正如同你所说的，你还有其他的问题吗？}
{118}{}{非常不幸，一些商队先后失踪了，远行商队正为此事发出悬赏。有知情者将得到重谢。如果你感兴趣可以去市场那边看看。}
{119}{}{他拥有的马耳他猎鹰就在市场区，但是我提醒你，别淌这碗混水，最好离他远点。他除了杀动物什么都不会，但是警长说由于证据不足，暂时还不能逮捕他。}
{120}{}{放心吧，信不信由你，我们的城市非常安全，而且我们的警察都是高素质的治安监管员。如果你不招惹马耳他猎鹰，就不会出事。}
{121}{}{不好意思，我不是很明白。也许你需要去看看病，大教堂教徒的医院在南方。沿商业区直下是纯水商队做生意的地方，他们正好挨着纯水商队。}
{122}{}{我一直都在盯着你，你这杀过小孩的人渣。}
{123}{}{杀动物！}
{124}{}{我不相信警长死了……}
{125}{}{你在这呀！你个毛贼！我差点就没认出你来，警卫！}
{126}{}{当然。}
{127}{}{如果你有能力就来抓我呀！}
{128}{}{不。}
{129}{}{我靠！}
{130}{}{又见面了，非常希望你能喜欢我们这，像你这样的帅哥一定会受欢迎的，如果你打算留下，我保证对于整个哈勃城都是件好事。}
{131}{}{又见面了，非常希望你能喜欢我们这，像你这样的美女一定会受欢迎的，如果你打算留下，我保证对于整个哈勃城都是件好事。}
{132}{}{又见面了，有什么需要帮忙的吗？}
{133}{}{啥？我没时间，我讨厌整天看大门。}
{134}{}{我要报案！}
{135}{}{我受伤了，我需要去医院。}
{136}{}{附近有商店吗？}
{137}{}{附近哪有工作？}
{138}{}{拜拜。}
{139}{}{格卢母？}
{140}{}{欧巴！}
{141}{}{真的？我，恩，你应该去找警长说话，我不能擅自离岗，我要是……去的话，那些歹徒该趁机溜进来了，况且，我口才也不好，怕说不清楚耽误了事情。}
{142}{}{哦，抱歉，我没注意。过了大教堂教徒的医院就能看到纯水商队。在市场南边你正好可以看到西北方的纯水商队，祝你一路顺风。}
{143}{}{城镇中最繁华的地方是很难错过的，商业区就在南边不远，北区的大部分东西会让你感兴趣的，我们本地大部分人都在北方做生意。}
{144}{}{这里向南不远就是市场，有2套房子都是商队的，还有一套有点远在南边，我推荐远行商队。他们待遇好，而且劳动强度没那么高。}
{145}{}{死了？他们都死了……}
{146}{}{扑扑扑……喳喳喳……}
{147}{}{你知道我在找净水芯片吗？我避难所的芯片发生了故障，我必须马上再找到一个才行。}
{148}{}{净水芯片？我从来没听说过那玩意。如果它是用水做的，也许纯水商队那能有，穿过市中心往南走就能看到他们的营地。}
