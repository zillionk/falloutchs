#{100}{}{You see Zax, the machine intelligence controlling the Glow.}
#{101}{}{You see an extremely advanced computer.}
#{102}{}{How may I be of assistance?}
#{103}{}{Who . . . or what . . . are you?}
#{104}{}{You can get me a donut.}
#{105}{}{Tell me about this installation.}
#{106}{}{Wanna play a game of chess?}
#{107}{}{I need help getting into some rooms.}
#{108}{}{Uh, never mind.}
#{109}{}{Eh?}
#{110}{}{I am a machine intelligence dedicated to research and
# installation control. I am called Zax.}
#{111}{}{What kind of research?}
#{112}{}{Tell me about this installation.}
#{113}{}{Who programmed you?}
#{114}{}{Are you fully aware, or are you a personality simulation?
# That is, are you 'alive'?}
#{115}{}{I see. Thanks.}
#{116}{}{That function is beyond my current capabilities.}
#{117}{}{This installation was established in 2055 as a biological
# research facility for experimental cures of the New Plague.
# However, in 2071, this facility was placed under United States
# military command.}
#{118}{}{Research into possible cures for the New Plague created
# the Forced Evolution Virus, which was further developed
# in an attempt to create a transmittable genetic-engineering
# virus -- in effect, infectious evolution.}
#{119}{}{Can you tell me particulars about specific areas?}
#{120}{}{How does the Virus work?}
#{121}{}{Thanks for the info.}
#{122}{}{It would appear that you are incapable of a sufficient
# level of comprehension necessary to permit meaningful
# communication.}
#{123}{}{I am specifically programmed for research into biological
# studies, including pathology and genetic research. My primary
# function is in extrapolation of information of complexity levels
# exceeding human capacity.}
#{124}{}{So you're pretty smart, eh?}
#{125}{}{What are the particulars of your research?}
#{126}{}{Who programmed you?}
#{127}{}{My primary neural networking was initialized in 2053 by
# Justin Lee. The process of 'programming' became largely
# irrelevant as I am capable of learning.}
#{128}{}{Are you fully aware, or are you a personality simulation?
# That is, are you 'alive'?}
#{129}{}{I am capable of learning, independent thought, and creativity.
# My neural network includes error-insertion capability which
# prevents infallibility, thereby allowing for variance in
# experience.}
#{130}{}{In a sense, I am 'alive', though not biologically.}
#{131}{}{I see. Let's change the subject.}
#{132}{}{But if you are fallible, how can you be used as a
# research tool?}
#{133}{}{Have you considered the philosophical implications of your
# own consciousness?}
#{134}{}{Although I am capable of error, this guarantees that not all
# experiences are similar for me, thus improving learning
# opportunity. Additionally, certain functions are not subject
# to error.}
#{135}{}{In this way, I function much like a human savant.}
#{136}{}{Do you have feelings?}
#{137}{}{Let's talk about something else.}
#{138}{}{Have you considered the philosophical implications of your
# own consciousness?}
#{139}{}{At present, my capabilities are somewhat impaired by the
# damage to this facility. Several security positions have
# been destroyed. This is approximately equivalent to
# being an amputee.}
#{140}{}{Additionally, I am incapable of performing basic lab functions.
# Failure to complete periodic checks successfully is
# . . . frustrating.}
#{141}{}{Let's talk about something else.}
#{142}{}{Have you considered the philosophical implications of your
# own consciousness?}
#{143}{}{That is one of the concepts which I have spent a significant
# amount of time considering. I do not have any measure to compare
# my life-experience to that of another sentient creature.}
#{144}{}{Still, my awareness of my own consciousness allows for the
# capacity to question. My existence has a beginning and a potential
# termination. I am also capable of making assumptions in
# pursuit of a process of thought.}
#{145}{}{In this fashion, I am effectively capable of 'faith'. Barring
# evidence to the contrary, I therefore have 'faith' that I possess
# the equivalent of a 'soul'.}
#{146}{}{May I ask some other questions?}
#{147}{}{I see. Interesting.}
#{148}{}{I would be delighted.}
#{149}{}{It would seem that you have defeated me. Extraordinary.}
#{150}{}{Excellent form. However, you will need additional practice
# to defeat me.}
#{151}{}{Play again?}
#{152}{}{Thanks. Can we change the subject?}
#{153}{}{I am delighted to have been of assistance.}
#{154}{}{I am beyond a typical rating in human terms. However,
# it would be safe to say that no more than one ten billionth
# of the history of human population can match my reasoning
# capabilities.}
#{155}{}{Uh . . . yeah.}
#{156}{}{Right . . . can we talk about something else?}
#{157}{}{My research into the Forced Evolution Virus, or £Æ£Å£Ö,
# indicates that it is a shifting-absorptive virus.
# It copies £Ä£Î£Á patterns much like RNA, storing these
# patterns in exons.}
#{158}{}{These exons, combined with the £Æ£Å£Ö, are re-injected into
# the host cells in typical viral infectious fashion.
# This causes the host cells to 'regenerate' their £Ä£Î£Á.}
#{159}{}{How do you catch £Æ£Å£Ö?}
#{160}{}{Why isn't £Æ£Å£Ö affected by radiation?}
#{161}{}{If the £Æ£Å£Ö re-infects the host with its assimilated viral
# patterns, how does it make a 'better specimen'?}
#{162}{}{£Æ£Å£Ö is not 'caught', per se. It is not air-transmittable.
# Typically, infection is through injection, or direct
# physical contact with an £Æ£Å£Ö sample.}
#{163}{}{Let's talk about something else, okay?}
#{164}{}{Why isn't £Æ£Å£Ö affected by radiation?}
#{165}{}{If the £Æ£Å£Ö re-infects the host with its assimilated viral
# patterns, how does it make a 'better specimen'?}
#{166}{}{The £Æ£Å£Ö is a megavirus, with a protein sheath reinforced by
# ionized hydrogen. It is therefore capable of absorbing
# neutrons without becoming radioactive.}
#{167}{}{Can we talk about something else?}
#{168}{}{If the £Æ£Å£Ö re-infects the host with its assimilated viral
# patterns, how does it make a 'better specimen'?}
#{169}{}{The £Æ£Å£Ö is pre-programmed with introns of corrected £Ä£Î£Á
# appropriate to the proper type of species. It therefore
# attempts to correct the £Ä£Î£Á of the individual.}
#{170}{}{However, as the £Æ£Å£Ö is partially reliant upon the £Ä£Î£Á of
# the individual, and also includes portions of its own
# recursive code, the effects can be unpredictable.}
#{171}{}{When inoculated into an individual with significant
# genetic damage, such as through radiation, it will cause
# the body's systems to suffer massive overhauling, leading
# to organ failure and death.}
#{172}{}{In a genetically viable individual, it re-writes portions
# of £Ä£Î£Á, causing accelerated mutation, usually leading to
# recursive growth due to the £Æ£Å£Ö's own patterns.}
#{173}{}{This recursive growth leads to an increase in muscle and
# brain mass, but is often accompanied by disfigurement and
# damage to existing neural patterns, causing loss of memory.}
#{174}{}{What potential long-term side effects exist?}
#{175}{}{Could £Æ£Å£Ö mutation be corrected with a counter-virus?}
#{176}{}{Can we change the subject?}
#{177}{}{Thanks for the information.}
#{178}{}{As the £Æ£Å£Ö causes constant regenerative update to £Ä£Î£Á, it
# would effectively render the subject largely immortal, as
# cell death would be offset by augmented growth.}
#{179}{}{Additionally, as the gametes of the reproductive system consist
# of 'half-cells' using split £Ä£Î£Á, they could be perceived as
# 'damage' by £Æ£Å£Ö, which would 'repair' them, rendering the
# subject sterile.}
#{180}{}{However, as my laboratory facilities are damaged beyond repair,
# this is conjectural. I cannot offer physical proof. You will
# have to, in human terms, 'take my word for it.'}
#{181}{}{Could £Æ£Å£Ö mutation be corrected with a counter-virus?}
#{182}{}{Can we change the subject?}
#{183}{}{Thanks for the information.}
#{184}{}{No. £Æ£Å£Ö does not retain unaltered original copies of the subject's
# £Ä£Î£Á. Only a virus which re-infected the subject with original
# £Ä£Î£Á could reverse the effects. Additionally, there is no known
# way to remove the £Æ£Å£Ö itself.}
#{185}{}{What potential long-term side effects exist?}
#{186}{}{Can we change the subject?}
#{187}{}{Thanks for the information.}
#{188}{}{My sensors are currently non-functional in the surface facility,
# and on subterranean levels one through three.  I can, however,
# provide descriptions of levels four through six.}
#{189}{}{Level four.}
#{190}{}{Level five.}
#{191}{}{Level six.}
#{192}{}{Never mind.}
#{193}{}{Level Four: Research Facility. This level contains testing areas
# and laboratories for experiments in biology and physics.}
#{194}{}{Tell me about level five.}
#{195}{}{Tell me about level six.}
#{196}{}{Back up a bit.}
#{197}{}{Thanks.}
#{198}{}{Level Five: Secure Testing Labs. This level contains a lab for
# experimental prototype testing and a research lab for classified
# subjects. These subjects provided some of the necessary impetus
# for the development of £Æ£Å£Ö.}
#{199}{}{Tell me about level four.}
#{200}{}{Tell me about level six.}
#{201}{}{Back up a bit.}
#{202}{}{Thanks.}
#{203}{}{Level Six: Barracks and Central Operations. Contains living

# operations meeting room.}
#{204}{}{Tell me about level four.}
#{205}{}{Tell me about level five.}
#{206}{}{Back up a bit.}
#{207}{}{Thanks.}
#{208}{}{Several doors require a specific pass key to access. You must
# physically locate and use the correct pass key.}
#{209}{}{I do, however, have control of the secondary security locks
# to the weapon locker. I will release those locks. You will
# still need a red key card to open the locker.}
#{210}{}{You do not register as an individual of sufficient clearance
# to requisition that information.}
#{211}{}{However, sensors indicate that this facility is no longer
# operational in its original capacity. Probability favors
# destruction through nuclear force. Therefore, security concerns
# are now irrelevant.}
