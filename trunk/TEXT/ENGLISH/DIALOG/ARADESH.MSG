#{100}{}{You see Aradesh.}
{100}{}{你看见亚拉德什。}

#{101}{Ara_1g}{Greetings, wanderer. Please do not be offended if the
#gentlefolk about seem rude. As Dharma said, 'Tough
#times tan the human hide.' Your business in Shady
#Sands might be?}
{101}{Ara_1g}{你好，旅行者。可能居民们或许有点粗鲁，请不要生气。达玛说：“艰苦岁月让人蒙上兽皮。”你来荒漠小镇有何贵干？}

#{102}{Ara_1n}{Greetings. Your business in Shady Sands might be?}
{102}{Ara_1n}{你好。你来荒漠小镇有何贵干？}

#{103}{Ara_1b}{We don't take to strangers much. Your business in
#Shady Sands?}
{103}{Ara_1b}{我们这里很少有外来者。你来荒漠小镇有何贵干？}

#{104}{}{I'm from a small village west of here. I'm just
#exploring and mean you no harm.}
{104}{}{我来自于这里西面的一个小村子。我在勘探并且无恶意。}

#{105}{}{What's it to you?}
{105}{}{你想知道什么？}

#{106}{}{My reasons are mine to keep.}
{106}{}{我保留我的理由。}

#{107}{}{I'm from a Vault to the west. My people are dying

#{108}{}{I'm saving an entire people from destruction!}
{108}{}{我正在从毁灭中拯救所有人们！}

#{109}{}{Shady Sands? Whoops, I'm lost! I'll just be going now.}
{109}{}{荒漠小镇？哎呀，我迷路了！我得走了。}

#{110}{}{Hunh?}
{110}{}{哈？}

#{111}{Ara_2}{I know of no village to the west.}
{111}{Ara_2}{据我所知西面没有村子。}

#{112}{}{Have you been through the mountains west of here?}
{112}{}{你翻过这里西面的山吗？}

#{113}{}{So?}
{113}{}{那么？}

#{114}{}{Are you saying you know every location from here
#to the ocean?}
{114}{}{你的意思是，你了解从这里到海洋的每个地方？}

#{115}{}{I'm sure you've been many places, but you must have
#missed my tiny village.}
{115}{}{我相信你到过很多地方，不过你一定遗漏了我在的小村庄。}

#{116}{Ara_3}{Ah well, to my regret, I have not. Which begs the question,
#how did you make that passage?}
{116}{Ara_3}{哦，那么，很遗憾，我没有。那么让我重复一次我的问题，你是怎么到这里的？}

#{117}{}{It was pretty tough, but I made it.}
{117}{}{很辛苦，不过我还是熬过来了。}

#{118}{}{What's it to you?}
{118}{}{你想知道什么？}

#{119}{}{Look, all I wanted was a few supplies and things,
#but I will gladly go elsewhere.}
{119}{}{听着，我想要的只是一些补给和其它东西，不过我会很高兴去别的地方弄。}

#{120}{}{I don't need to answer you.}
{120}{}{我不需要回答你。}

#{121}{Ara_4}{Yes, hmmm, yes, yes. yes. I shall believe you...for now.
#But we do not trust easily, especially those who might be dangerous.
#Know that Seth and I will be watching you.}
{121}{Ara_4}{是的，嗯，是是是。我相信你．．．于现在而言。不过我们不会轻易相信人，特别是对于那些可能是危险分子的人而言。请你清楚，塞斯和我会盯着你的一举一动。}

#{122}{Ara_5}{It is my town, wanderer. You must answer my questions
#or leave. This is not a matter of choice.}
{122}{Ara_5}{这是我的城镇，旅行者，你要么回答我的问题要么离开这里。这里没你选择的余地。}

#{123}{}{I don't have to tell you anything.}
{123}{}{我不必告诉你任何事情。}

#{124}{}{I mean you no harm, really.}
{124}{}{我对你无恶意，真的。}

#{125}{}{Don't worry, I'm leaving.}
{125}{}{别担心，我就走。}

#{126}{Ara_6}{You are quite insolent. I believe you should leave. Do
#not return. You will not be welcome.}
{126}{Ara_6}{你相当无礼。我想你应该离开。别回来。你不会受欢迎的。}

#{127}{Ara_7}{So be it, wanderer. Seth will show you out.}
{127}{Ara_7}{好吧，旅行者。塞斯会带你出去的。}

#{128}{Ara_8}{You must think me quite gullible, wanderer. You
#conquered the mountains by yourself?}
{128}{Ara_8}{你一定以为我很容易欺骗，旅行者。你一个人征服了那些山脉？}

#{129}{}{Doesn't matter how I think. It's true I came
#from the mountains.}
{129}{}{我怎么想不重要。我从那些山脉翻过来是事实。}

#{130}{}{No, just stupid.}
{130}{}{不，仅仅是愚蠢而已。}

#{131}{Ara_9}{As Dharma said, 'Caution is life in troubled times.'
#Your origin is not the issue. Your intent is.}
{131}{Ara_9}{如达玛所说，“危急关头冷静就是生命”你从哪里来的不是问题。而你的目的才是。}

#{132}{}{Okay.}
{132}{}{好吧。}

#{133}{Ara_9A}{I will let you pass, but know this: Seth and I will
#watch you very, very closely. Do not even consider
#bringing trouble here.}
{133}{Ara_9A}{我会让你进来，不过清楚这点：塞斯和我会很小心盯着你的，很小心的。你想都别想在这里惹麻烦。}

#{134}{Ara_10}{And keep them you may. But this is not a city of
#open hospitality. If you desire that, go to Junktown.
#You may enter, but know we have our eyes on you.}
{134}{Ara_10}{你可以干你想干得事。不过这里不是一个公开好客的地方。如果你想的话，去迦克镇。你可以进来，不过要知道，我们会盯着你的。}

#{135}{Ara_11}{A Vault. How shall I trust you, wanderer, when you
#are not honest with me?}
{135}{Ara_11}{一个避难所。我该怎么相信你，旅行者，如果你对我不诚实的话？}

#{136}{}{No, honestly, I come from a Vault!}
{136}{}{不，真的，我从一个避难所来的！}

#{137}{}{The Vault is . . . the name of my village.}
{137}{}{这避难所是．．．是我村子的名称。}

#{138}{}{You're right, I was lying.}
{138}{}{你没错，我是撒谎。}

#{139}{Ara_12}{Hmmm, yes, yes, yes. Then tell me of this Vault.}
{139}{Ara_12}{嗯，是是是。那么就给说说这个避难所。}

#{140}{}{Well . . . the Vault is actually the name of my town.
#We name it that because it's in between two big cliffs.}
{140}{}{呃．．．避难所其实就是我在城镇的名称。我们取这个名字是因为它在两个大峭壁的中间。}

#{141}{}{It's a big place built into a mountain far to the west.
#My people have been there for the last 80 years.}
{141}{}{那是一个建在遥远西面的一座山中的一个很大的地方。我的人民已经在那里居住了８０年了。}

#{142}{}{Why do you want to know?}
{142}{}{你为什么想知道？}

#{143}{Ara_13}{Wanderer, I shall believe you . . . for now. You may
#enter Shady Sands, but be warned your every move will be watched.}
{143}{Ara_13}{旅行者，我相信你．．．现在相信你。你可以进入荒漠小镇，不过我告诫你，你的所有举动都会被注意。}

{152}{Ara_17}{你好，又再见了，年轻的旅行者。我希望住在这里合你意。}

#{153}{}{It's been great. Can I ask you some questions?}
{153}{}{这里很不错。我可以问些问题吗？}

#{154}{}{It has. I gotta run though.}
{154}{}{是的。不过我该走了。}

#{155}{}{If you like sewers.}
{155}{}{如果你喜欢下水道的话。}

#{156}{}{Nuh-huh.}
{156}{}{嗯嗯。}

#{157}{Ara_18n}{Greetings. What may I help you with this fine day?}
{157}{Ara_18n}{你好。天气不错，我有什么能帮你么？}

#{160}{}{I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions?}
{160}{}{我想我可以问你一些问题吗？}

#{161}{}{Nothing, really, I was just leaving.}
{161}{}{没事，真的没事，我要走了。}

#{162}{}{Nuh-uh.}
{162}{}{嗯嗯。}

#{163}{Ara_19}{Certainly. What do you wish to know?}
{163}{Ara_19}{当然可以。你希望知道什么？}

#{164}{Ara_19b}{You may ask, but please hurry. There are more important uses for my time.}
{164}{Ara_19b}{你可以问，不过请快点。我的时间还有更重要地方来花。}

{167}{}{谢谢。再见。}

#{168}{Ara_20g}{Ah. Happy journeys, wanderer.}
{168}{Ara_20g}{啊。祝你旅途愉快，旅行者。}

#{169}{Ara_20n}{Goodbye.}
{169}{Ara_20n}{再见。}

#{170}{Ara_20b}{I certainly hope so.}
{170}{Ara_20b}{我无疑希望你走。}

#{171}{Ara_21}{Dharma said, 'A man and his wayward tongue are soon parted.' Come back
#when you have learned some manners.}
{171}{Ara_21}{达玛说过，“任何人和他不听话的舌头都会马上分家。”等你什么时候懂得礼貌了再回来吧。}

#{172}{Ara_22}{That is quite enough, wanderer. Seth will show
#you out of the city. Do not return. Your welcome will not be pleasant.}
{172}{Ara_22}{这就实在是够了，旅行者。赛思会带你出去。不要回来。欢迎你不会令人愉快。}

#{173}{Ara_23g}{Shady Sands is much like a family, one that keeps
#to itself.}
{173}{Ara_23g}{荒漠小镇很像一个家庭，自给自足，也足够保护自己。}

#{174}{Ara_23b}{We are a very protective community. As Dharma said,
#'Many sticks can be broken. A bundle cannot.'}
{174}{Ara_23b}{我们是一个很有自我保护意识的社区。如达玛所说，“许多小枝条都能被轻易折断，但是一束就不会。”}

#{177}{}{How cute. Well, I better be going.}
{177}{}{真机灵。那么，我最好还是走吧。}

#{178}{Ara_24}{The Gardens are on the south side. The Brahma Pens
#are north, although the smell is, I fear, quite intense this time of year.}
{178}{Ara_24}{花园在南边。双头牛场在北边，虽然那里的气味实在是，我恐怕，在每年的这个时候相当强烈。}

#{179}{}{Anything else?}
{179}{}{还有什么吗？}

#{180}{Ara_24a}{We are small and self sufficient so there is little else
#to tell.}
{180}{Ara_24a}{我们是自给自足的小地方，所以没有多少说的。}

#{181}{}{Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{181}{}{谢谢。我可以多问一些问题吗？}

#{182}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{182}{}{谢谢。再见。}

#{184}{}{Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{184}{}{谢谢。我可以多问一些问题吗？}

#{185}{Ara_25b}{Dharma said, 'Heed not the call of the wolf when the fox is raiding
#the hen house.'}
{185}{Ara_25b}{达玛说，“狐狸进鸡舍的时候就要想想会不会招来狼。”}

#{186}{Ara_25g}{Junktown lies south of here, though there is little in
#the way of visitation. From stories, I'm certain there
#are cities south of that.}
{186}{Ara_25g}{迦克镇在这里的南方，虽然访问那里的路线不多。从记事上看来，我很肯定那里的南面有城市。}

#{187}{}{Thanks. I . . . Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{187}{}{谢谢。我．．．我可以再问一些问题吗？}

#{188}{Ara_26}{It is a quiet time, thankfully.}
{188}{Ara_26}{幸运的，现在还没有什么事。}

#{189}{}{Sounds . . . boring}
{189}{}{听起来．．．挺闷。}

#{190}{}{Well, then, can I ask you a few more questions?}
{190}{}{嗯，那么，我可以再多问几个问题吗？}

#{191}{}{Good. Hopefully it will stay that way for a while.}
{191}{}{好。希望这样能维持一段时间。}

#{192}{Ara_27}{Yes. We like it that way.}
{192}{Ara_27}{是的。我希望能如此。}

#{193}{}{What can you tell me about the other towns around here?}

#{195}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{195}{}{谢谢。再见。}

#{196}{Ara_28}{Oh my yes. Great packs of Rad Scorpions are killing
#our herds. We don't know where they're from, and no
#matter how many we kill, there's always more!}
{196}{Ara_28}{哦，确实有。一大群辐射蝎正在杀我们的牛群。我们不知道他们从哪里来的，而且不管我们杀了多少辐射蝎，那里总会有更多的出现。}

#{197}{}{Go on.}
{197}{}{继续。}

#{198}{Ara_28a}{And now the monsters are attacking my people! Razlo

#sure how it goes.}
{198}{Ara_28a}{而且现在这些怪物正在攻击我的人民！拉斯洛正在寻找一种治疗蝎毒的方法，不过我不能确定现在怎么样了。}

#{199}{}{Well, I'll help you get rid of these things!}
{199}{}{好，我会帮你消灭那些东西！}

#{200}{}{I can help you for a price.}
{200}{}{我可以帮助你，不过需要一定的代价。}

#{201}{}{That's terrible. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{201}{}{那真糟糕。我能再问你一些问题吗？}

#{202}{Ara_29}{Ummm, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Please talk to Razlo. He
#possesses far more information on these creatures than I.}
{202}{Ara_29}{嗯，是是是是是！请跟拉斯洛谈谈。他比我更清楚那种生物的事情。}

#{203}{Ara_30}{As Dharma said, 'Those who tend their own flock,
#know the shepherd.'}
{203}{Ara_30}{如达玛所说，“自发团结过得人才知道领导的可贵。”}

#{206}{Ara_30a}{Please hurry and rid us of those Rad Scorpions!}
{206}{Ara_30a}{请尽快帮我们消灭掉那些辐射蝎！}

#{207}{Ara_31}{Things are much more settled now. Razlo has been working
#on a cure for Rad Scorpion poison, and with that, we should be
#able to fight what's left of them.}
{207}{Ara_31}{现在事情稳定多了。拉斯洛正在弄蝎毒的治疗方法，有了这个，我们应该就可以把还剩下来的辐射蝎消灭了。}

#{208}{}{It was nothing. Can I ask you some more questions?}
{208}{}{没什么。我可以再问你些问题吗？}

#{209}{}{You don't need to worry anymore. I destroyed the Nest.}
{209}{}{你不需要再担心什么了。我消灭了他们的巢穴。}

#{210}{Ara_32}{You are truly a hero! Know that the people of Shady
#Sands are most grateful.}

{255}{Ara_53}{她可是个好姑娘。刚庆祝了她的１６岁生日! 她常和拉斯洛待在一起, 总和他聊那些亲身经历，她都把那些故事当成宝了。}

#{256}{Ara_54}{Ummm, um, um. Very bad. There are two bands of raiders

# the Khans.}
{256}{Ara_54}{哼，嗯，嗯。太糟了。据我们所知附近就有两伙强盗。他们自称毒蛇和可汗。}

# here knows of their base.}
{257}{Ara_55}{对这些人要尤其小心。那些狂热迷信的强盗非常危险。这里也没人知道他们的老巢在哪。}

# during the War.}
{260}{Ara_58}{是的，是的，是的。据说这是种在战争中产生的动物。}

#{262}{Ara_60}{Junktown is south or here. Their merchants occasionally
# come to trade, but not often.}
{262}{Ara_60}{迦克镇在这里的南方。那里的商人有时会来做买卖，不过不经常来。}

#{263}{Ara_61}{The Vipers and Khans both use spears. We know this from

#{273}{Ara_71}{I shall not repeat myself so often as to make myself
# sound stupid. Please listen next time.}
{273}{Ara_71}{我不会像个傻瓜那样把说过的话重复那么多遍。请下次再洗耳恭听吧。}

#{274}{Ara_72}{I will not stand here like a sputtering candle simply
# because you cannot listen.}
{274}{Ara_72}{你不听的话，我也不会对牛弹琴。}

#{275}{Ara_73}{Go talk to Seth about that. He'll know more than I.}
{275}{Ara_73}{去问问赛思吧。他比我更懂这些。}
