#{100}{}{You see Jennifer.}
{100}{}{你看见詹妮佛。}

#{101}{}{You see a Paladin.}
{101}{}{你看见一名圣骑士。}

#{102}{}{Excuse me, Brother. You should put away your weapon whenever
# you are in the Brotherhood. We are a friendly order, but as
# you know, times are rough.}
{102}{}{抱歉，一旦你走进了兄弟会，你要把你的武器收好。我们是个友好的组织，但是你也知道，现在的时局不太平。}

#{103}{}{Some members of the Brotherhood might be offended if a
# stranger . . . I mean, a new Initiate . . . approaches them
# with a weapon.}
{103}{}{如果一个陌生人．．．呃，我是说新兵．．．带着武器靠近某些兄弟会成员，他们会发火的。}

#{104}{}{Good day, Initiate. How may I help you?}
{104}{}{你好，新兵，我能帮你什么呢？}

#{105}{}{Hello, Sister, it's good to see there are women of rank in
# this organization. I didn't know what to expect with a name like
# the Brotherhood.}
{105}{}{你好啊，妹妹。很高兴看到我们女同胞也进入了兄弟会。我都不知道以后兄弟会这个名字是不是要改改了。}

#{106}{}{Hey there, legs. You are looking mighty fine. What time should
# I pick you up?}
{106}{}{嗨，甜妞，你看起来不错，什么时候我带你耍？}

#{107}{}{Oooooga!}
{107}{}{噢噢哦噢噢哦！}

#{108}{}{Could you tell me where I might find our High Elder?}
{108}{}{你知道我在哪里可以找到资深长老么？}

#{109}{}{Who's in charge of this hole?}
{109}{}{谁是这个破洞的管事？}

#{110}{}{Where's this High Elder guy?}
{110}{}{资深长老那厮在哪里？}

#{111}{}{Gruk!}
{111}{}{咕噜！}

#{112}{}{Maxson, the High Elder, can be found on the Fourth Floor.
# If you take the other elevator down to level four, he should
# be either in the Council Room or the Elders's rooms.}
{112}{}{资深长老马克松在第四层。你可以坐另外那部电梯下去。他应该在会议室或者长老室。}

#{113}{}{You can ask one of the guards on that level; they should know
# where he is at the moment.}
{113}{}{你可以问问那层的守卫，他们应该知道他的下落。}

#{114}{}{Thank you.}
{114}{}{谢谢。}

#{115}{}{Where can I get some better weapons?}
{115}{}{我到哪里拿到更好的武器？}

#{116}{}{You should talk to Talus. He might be able to help you, or
# at least tell you who to talk to.}
{116}{}{你应该和塔卢斯说说。他也许能帮你，或者至少他会告诉你去和谁说。}

#{117}{}{During the day, Talus is normally supervising in the training hall.
# Do you know where that is?}
{117}{}{白天的时候，塔卢斯一般会在训练室督导，你知道训练室怎么走吧？}

#{118}{}{Yes, I do. Thank you.}
{118}{}{知道，多谢了。}

#{119}{}{No.}
{119}{}{不知道。}

#{120}{}{Of course I do!}
{120}{}{我当然知道！}

#{121}{}{The training hall is right around the corner. Just go down this
# corridor, make a left, go through the door at the end of
# the corridor and it will be through the door on your right.}
{121}{}{走廊拐过去就是训练室。顺着这条走廊走，左转，一直走道底，进门往右便是了。}

#{122}{}{You have been extremely helpful. Thank you very much.
# I hope we can talk again soon. Good day.}
{122}{}{你说的太清楚了！谢谢谢谢！我待会再来和你聊，再见。}

#{123}{}{Training hall? Do you think I could get some training there?
# I am a member of the Brotherhood now, right?}
{123}{}{训练室？我可以在那里得到训练么？我现在已经是兄弟会成员了啊，对吧？}

#{124}{}{Thank you for your help, Sister. It's good to see there are
# women of rank in this organization. I didn't know what to
# expect with a name like the Brotherhood.}
{124}{}{谢谢你，姐姐。很高兴看到我们女同胞也进入了兄弟会。我都不知道以后兄弟会这个名字是不是要改改了。}

#{125}{}{Thanks, Sugar. You know, you're looking mighty fine. What
# do you say you and me check out each other's 'equipment'
# later? What time do you get off?}
{125}{}{多谢甜心。你看起来很不错啊。要不我们找机会互相检查一下“装备”？你什么时候有空啊？}

#{126}{}{Oh, that place. Okay, bye.}
{126}{}{啊，那里，好，再见。}

#{127}{}{Excuse me? Is there something wrong?}
{127}{}{对不起，你有什么毛病么？}

#{128}{}{Muk lug?}
{128}{}{穆穆？}

#{129}{}{I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you. You should go see the
# doctor. She's on the second level.}
{129}{}{对不起，我帮不上你的忙，你应该去看看医生，她在第二层。}

#{130}{}{Of course there are. Two of our five Elders are women, our master
# scribe is a woman, and we have many other women in all the
# different ranks.}
{130}{}{没错，五大长老里有两人是女的，我们的总研究员芙蕾也是女的，各个职位上都有我们女性。}

#{131}{}{The women of the Brotherhood are also called Brothers. We don't call
# the women Sisters. This is the Brotherhood of Steel, after all,
# not the Brother and Sisterhood of Steel.}
{131}{}{兄弟会的女性也要称呼为兄弟，我们不会姐姐妹妹的乱叫。这里毕竟是钢铁兄弟会，不是钢铁兄弟姊妹会什么的。}

#{132}{}{Don't you find it peculiar that it is called the Brotherhood,
# implying that its members consist solely of men?}
{132}{}{你不觉得叫钢铁兄弟会很特别么，搞的好像这里只有男人似的。}

#{133}{}{But why is it called the Brotherhood, then?}
{133}{}{那么为什么要叫做兄弟会呢？}

#{134}{}{Well, it just seemed strange.}
{134}{}{就是有点怪嘛。}

#{135}{}{I do not know. That has been our name all of my life. I'm sure
# there is a reason for it.}
{135}{}{我也不知道，我出生以来他们一直是叫这个名字，这肯定是有原由的。}

#{136}{}{I guess you're right.}
{136}{}{有道理。}

#{137}{}{Well, it still seems a little strange to me.}
{137}{}{我还是觉得这个名字怪怪的。}

#{138}{}{That is strange. I've never really put much thought into it.
# We've been the Brotherhood of Steel all of my life. Our
# ancestors must have had a reason for naming it so.}
{138}{}{是很怪，但我从来没怎么想过。我出生以来他们一直是叫这个名字，先人们起这个名字肯定是有原因的。}

#{139}{}{But that doesn't mean things can't change.}
{139}{}{这不代表以后不会改。}

#{140}{}{Yeah, you're probably right.}
{140}{}{嗯，你说的对。}

#{141}{}{So, is there anything else I can help you with?}
{141}{}{那么我还能帮你什么？}

#{142}{}{Yes, where can I find the High Elder?}
{142}{}{我想找资深长老。}

#{143}{}{Where can I get better weapons?}
{143}{}{我想要更好的武器。}

#{144}{}{No, that's it. Bye.}
{144}{}{没事了，再见。}

#{145}{}{No, we're very strict when it comes to tradition. I don't think
# it could ever be changed. It doesn't bother me at all to be
# addressed as a Brother. That is curious, though.}
{145}{}{不会的，我们严格遵循传统，名字应该不会改变的。叫我兄弟我其实也无所谓了，虽然有点怪。}

#{146}{}{I think I'll have a talk with Vree. She might be able to give
# some insight as to why our ancestors decided to call us the
# Brotherhood of Steel.}
{146}{}{我应该和芙蕾聊聊去，她应该知道为什么前辈们要起这样一个名字。}

#{147}{}{Who's Vree? One of the Elders?}
{147}{}{谁是芙蕾？她是长老？}

#{148}{}{Vree's the Master Scribe. She is the one you should talk to
# if you have any technical questions, but don't disturb her
# during her meditations at night.}
{148}{}{她是我们的总研究员，如果你有技术问题，就应该去问她，但是不要在她冥想的时候去打搅她。}

#{149}{}{She almost always stays in her room, which is also occupied
# by the mainframe on the third floor.}
{149}{}{她永远都呆在自己的房间里，就在第三层的中央。}

#{150}{}{Hole? How dare you talk like that about the Brotherhood.
# You are a member of our order now, and should be proud
# to be a member of the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{150}{}{破洞？你怎么这么说钢铁兄弟会？你是一名兄弟会成员了，你要对自己的组织怀有敬意！}

#{151}{}{Proud? Why? You're all just a bunch of robotic hop-heads, hiding
# from the real world. There's nothing to be proud of there.}
{151}{}{敬意？为什么？你们就是一群机械化偏执狂，只会逃避世界。我对这里没什么敬意。}

#{152}{}{I'm sorry. I get a little carried away with myself
# sometimes.}
{152}{}{对不起，我有时候说话挺没谱的。}

#{153}{}{Yeah, right.}
{153}{}{啊，对。}

#{154}{}{Well, I guess we all do sometimes.}
{154}{}{人都有说漏嘴的时候吧。}

#{155}{}{So who is in charge of this place?}
{155}{}{那谁是这个地方的主管？}

#{156}{}{Yeah. Well, I've got to go.}
{156}{}{你说的对，我走了。}

#{157}{}{Maxson, the High Elder. He's on the fourth floor.}
{157}{}{高级长老马克松，在第四层。}

#{158}{}{}
{158}{}{}

#{159}{}{}
{159}{}{}

#{160}{}{}
{160}{}{}

#{161}{}{}
{161}{}{}

#{162}{}{}
{162}{}{}

#{163}{}{Well, you are cute . . . but I don't think so. I don't think
# it would be a good idea to get involved with an outsider,
# anyways. You are cute, though, and somewhat attractive. }
{163}{}{你是很帅．．．但是我不会和你那什么的。我想我不应该和一个外面来的人纠缠不清的。不过，你的确很帅，很有吸引力。}

#{164}{}{I don't know if it's because you're an outsider or because
# of your extreme . . . lack of tact? So, 'honey', is there
# anything else I can do for you?}
{164}{}{这个．．．我不知道是因为你是外来的，还是因为你太过．．．那个．．．直率了。那么，“甜心”，我还能为你做什么呢？}

#{165}{}{Yeah, uh, I guess. Uh, who's in charge around here?}
{165}{}{啊，对。谁是这里的主管？}

#{166}{}{Uh, okay . . . um. How about some weapons then? Where can
# I get my hands on some of those?}
{166}{}{哦，好吧．．．这里有什么好武器么？我怎么才能拿到？}

#{167}{}{Hmmph!}
{167}{}{呼呼！}

#{168}{}{No.}
{168}{}{没了。}

#{169}{}{That's . . . pretty funny. You are joking, I hope? Actually . . .
# don't answer that. I don't think I want to know.}
{169}{}{真是．．．有趣，你在开玩笑吧，是吧？实际上．．．不要这么说。我也不想知道了。}

#{170}{}{Yeah, REAL funny. Almost as much as your face!}
{170}{}{太有趣了，和你的脸蛋一样有趣！}

#{171}{}{Thanks a lot. That's exactly what I needed to hear right now.}
{171}{}{多谢，我就想知道这些了。}

#{172}{}{I'm out of here.}
{172}{}{我走了。}

#{173}{}{I'm sorry. It's just that you outsiders have such a strange
# way of talking to people sometimes. Is there anything I can
# help you with?}
{173}{}{对不起，你们外面来的和人说话都是这样怪怪的。我还能帮你什么？}

#{174}{}{Well, I guess I should talk to this High Elder person.
# Where is he at?}
{174}{}{好，我就去见见这个高级长老。他在哪里？}

#{175}{}{I would like to get some better weapons. Who do I talk
# to about that?}
{175}{}{我想要更好的武器，应该问谁要？}

#{176}{}{No.}
{176}{}{没事。}

#{177}{}{Are you for real? I haven't heard such a pitiful line
# in all my life!}
{177}{}{你来真的？我这辈子没听过这么无赖的话！}

#{178}{}{Yeah? Well, I don't get out much. Okay?}
{178}{}{哦？我的忍耐是有限的，明白？}

#{179}{}{Get out of my face, you walking garbage can!}
{179}{}{滚开！你这个垃圾。}

#{180}{}{Pfft!}
{180}{}{呸！}

#{181}{}{Well, yes, you are a member of the Brotherhood, but the Elders
# have put a hold on all training of new Initiates.}
{181}{}{没错，你是新成员了。但长老对于新兵训练有名额控制。}

#{182}{}{Why?}
{182}{}{为什么？}

#{183}{}{Oh, that's just GREAT! Why the hell did I join this stupid
# group? Where's the door?!}
{183}{}{我靠，这太好了！那我为什么还要加入这个愚蠢的组织？大门在哪里？！}

#{184}{}{There are rumors about some kind of army. I think the Elders
# want to concentrate their resources on the ones that are already
# far enough along in their training to make a difference if we
# do have a big battle on our hands.}
{184}{}{听说外面有邪恶的大军。长老们想用有限的训练资源使得那些原来基础不错的兄弟的武艺能上个台阶，如果有恶仗要打就能派上用场了。}

#{185}{}{We strongly believe that training a few fighters extremely
# well is better than giving mediocre training to a bunch of
# fighters. Saving lives is one of our primary objectives.}
{185}{}{兵贵精而不贵多。主要就是为了减少伤亡。}

#{186}{}{You could probably get quite a bit out of the training just
# by watching. Brother Thomas is the best trainer we have ever had
# at the Brotherhood.}
{186}{}{你可以旁观，也能学的不少。托马斯兄弟是我们这里最好的训练官。}

#{187}{}{Well, I'm to be working on the outside of the Brotherhood, right?
# It's a very hostile world out there and I'll be putting my life
# on the line every minute I'm out there. Don't you think I should
# be given training if I want or need it, or do you only 'say'
# it is your primary objective to 'save' lives?}
{187}{}{我要在兄弟会外面执行任务的，对吧？外面很危险啊，每时每刻我都是脑袋别在裤腰带上干活。你难道不觉得我有理由在我需要的时候接受训练么，这难道符合你们减少伤亡的初衷？！}

#{188}{}{Thank you for the suggestion, I'll take a look.}
{188}{}{多谢你的建议，我会去看看的。}

#{189}{}{You're all a bunch of fools.}
{189}{}{你们都是白痴！}

#{190}{}{Can you tell me where Maxson is?}
{190}{}{那马克松在哪里？}

#{191}{}{Well, I'm only repeating what I was told. If you talk to Thomas
# or Talus they might be able to make an exception.}
{191}{}{我也是转述我听到的话，你可以和托马斯或者塔卢斯聊聊，也许你可以被特许训练。}

#{192}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{192}{}{好，多谢。}

#{193}{}{They'd better. I've jumped through enough hoops for you guys.}
{193}{}{他们最好答应我，我这阵子也算是居功至伟了。}

#{194}{}{So, can you tell me where Maxson is?}
{194}{}{那么，你告诉我在哪里找到马克松吧。}

#{195}{}{Oh, my darling. When are we going to marry?}
{195}{}{哦，亲爱的，我们啥时候成亲哇？}

#{196}{}{You're looking so handsome, as always.}
{196}{}{你总是那么漂亮，总是。}

#{197}{}{Give me a kiss.}
{197}{}{来，给我个吻吧。}

#{198}{}{I've missed you so much.}
{198}{}{我好好好好想你哦。}

#{199}{}{I'll wait up for you.}
{199}{}{我会一直一直一直等你的。}

#{200}{}{I've been thinking about you all day.}
{200}{}{我成天脑袋里就是你的倩影在晃来晃去的。}

#{201}{}{You're so cute when you look at me like that.}
{201}{}{你看我的样子太楚楚动人了。}

#{202}{}{Don't scare me like that. I thought I'd never see you again.}
{202}{}{别吓我，我还以为不会在见到你了呢。}

#{203}{}{You didn't come by last night.}
{203}{}{你昨天晚上没来找我。}

#{204}{}{How long has it been since I've last seen you? It seems
# like an eternity.}
{204}{}{我上次见到你是什么时候？感觉似乎几个世纪了呢。}

#{205}{}{I've missed you ever so much.}
{205}{}{我都想死你了。}

#{206}{}{Come to bed, honey.}
{206}{}{上床去，亲爱的。}

#{207}{}{We can get married in the morning.}
{207}{}{我们可以明天上午去结婚。}

#{208}{}{I think we should have about five kids.}
{208}{}{我想我们会有５个孩子。}

#{209}{}{Where do you want to go for our honeymoon? I hear
# the Children of the Cathedral have a beautiful place.}
{209}{}{蜜月你想去哪里？听说教堂之子那里很漂亮。}

#{210}{}{My parents are still waiting to meet you.}
{210}{}{我爸妈还等着见你呢。}

#{211}{}{Why hello again. I hope things are well with you.
# I hope you've talked to Vree.}
{211}{}{又见面了，一切都还好吧，和芙蕾说过话了？}

#{212}{}{Hello, Brother }
{212}{}{你好，}

#{213}{}{.}
{213}{}{。}

#{214}{}{Be careful if you go to the north. Our scouts never returned.}
{214}{}{你去北方一定要小心，我们的探子都有去无回的。}

#{215}{}{Brother }
{215}{}{嗨，}

#{216}{}{, it's good to see you again.}
{216}{}{，又看到你真好。}

#{217}{}{Have you talked to Rhombus? He's the Head Knight. He's just
# right over there in that room.}
{217}{}{你和隆伯斯说过话了？他是骑士的领袖，他就在那边那个房间。}

#{218}{}{I don't have time to talk. I'm busy.}
{218}{}{我没时间说话，我很忙。}

#{219}{}{Sorry, I'm not in the mood to talk to rude people.}
{219}{}{对不起，我不想和粗鲁的人说话。}

#{220}{}{Don't bother me.}
{220}{}{别烦我。}

#{221}{}{What? Can't you go bother someone else?}
{221}{}{什么？你就不能去烦烦别人啊？}

#{222}{}{Go away.}
{222}{}{走开。}

#{223}{}{I don't want to talk to you.}
{223}{}{我不想和你说话。}

#{224}{}{Initiate, get back to your studies.}
{224}{}{新兵，回去学习。}

#{225}{}{No time to talk, Initiate.}
{225}{}{没时间和你说话，新兵。}

#{226}{}{Come over here, you hunk!}
{226}{}{来，大个子！}

#{227}{}{Darling, over here!}
{227}{}{亲爱的，来这里！}

#{228}{}{ I've missed you.}
{228}{}{我想你。}

#{229}{}{I've got the nursery ready, darling.}
{229}{}{我找到托儿所了，亲爱的。}

#{230}{}{Hi, honey.}
{230}{}{嗨，亲亲。}

#{231}{}{I see you.}
{231}{}{再见哦。}

#{232}{}{You've got to meet my parents.}
{232}{}{你应该去见见我爸妈。}

#{233}{}{Yoo hoo!}

{239}{}{你终于来了，我都开始担心了。}

#{240}{}{Come here and give me a kiss, handsome.}
{240}{}{来，给我一个吻，甜甜。}

#{241}{}{Come on in, darling.}
{241}{}{快来，亲爱的。}
