{1199}{}{我可以告诉你：Khans-可汗帮、Garl伽尔、Junktown-迦克镇、Shady-沙荫镇、Hub-哈勃城、Water-水、Tandi-坦蒂、Sands-沙荫镇、Chip-芯片。}

#{1000}{}{That's us, you lackey.}
#{1101}{}{I am the leader of the Khans.  I am the most feared man in the
# wasteland.}
#{1102}{}{They are to the southwest.  We sometimes go there to relax after
# a hard day pillaging.}
#{1103}{}{Miserable little piss ant community. I could crush them.}
#{1104}{}{They are to the south.  We trade with them.  Mostly for
# water and ammo, but sometimes for weapons.}
#{1105}{}{Why should I care?}
#{1106}{}{I don't know anyone by that name.}
#{1107}{}{Miserable little piss ant community. I could crush them.}
#{1108}{}{A what?}

#{100}{}{You see before you, Garl, leader of the Raiders.}
#{101}{}{You think you can come here without challenge?
# This, the home of your deadliest enemies? We will
# see you dead. I will personally tear your heart
# out of your chest and eat it before my proud
# warriors!}
#{102}{}{I killed you!}
#{103}{}{I don't get it.}
#{104}{}{Yes, you did. I've come back to haunt you.}
#{105}{}{You should not have done that.}
#{106}{}{I killed you!}
#{107}{}{I don't get it.}
#{108}{}{Yes, you did. I've come back to haunt you.}
#{109}{}{You should not have done that.}
#{110}{}{You would if you were my father, but you are not.
# You look like he did, but act different. No image
# of him remains to this day. You will just have to
# be removed.}
{100}{}{你看到伽尔，强盗的首领。}
{101}{}{你以为你到这来会平安无事？这里，是你死敌的地盘！我们会欣赏你是怎么死去的，当着我的勇士们面，我会亲自把你的心脏挖出来来吃掉，}
{102}{}{我已经杀掉你了！}
{103}{}{这是怎么回事。}
{104}{}{没错。可现在，我又出现在你面前了。}
{105}{}{你不可能这么做。}
{106}{}{我已经宰掉你了！}
{107}{}{这是怎么回事。}
{108}{}{没错。可现在，我又出现来你面前了。}
{109}{}{你不可能这么做。}
{110}{}{如果你是我爹，也许你能杀得了我。可你不是。虽然你看起来挺象他，可是行动可不象。他早不存在了。呆会儿你也就不存在了。}
#{111}{}{I don't believe it! I can't believe it!}
#{112}{}{Believe this buddy, and you're about to join me in Hell!}
#{113}{}{Don't tell me what I should have done, father. I rule the
# Khans now, and you are but worm meat.}
#{114}{}{I still live.}
#{115}{}{I should have killed you when you were a child.}
#{116}{}{Don't tell me what I should have done, father. I rule the
# Khans now, and you are but worm meat.}
#{117}{}{I still live.}
#{118}{}{I should have killed you when you were a child.}
#{119}{}{You should have. Now it's too late. I am Garl Death-Hand.
# I rule the Khans. You should be dead in your grave, and
# you will be again!}
#{120}{}{I can see you standing before me, but I don't believe
# it. What do you want?}
#{121}{}{I want the girl set free. Now.}
#{122}{}{I want you to step down.}
#{123}{}{I want riches to buy my way into Heaven.}
#{124}{}{Pledge that you shall return to the grave, and it shall
# be so.}
{111}{}{我不信！我不信！}
{112}{}{相信吧，伙计。你会跟我一起下地狱。}
{113}{}{父亲，你别跟我说我当初该怎么做。现在我是可汗，你不过是滩烂肉。}
{114}{}{我还活着。}
{115}{}{你还是个孩子的时候我就该弄死你。}
{116}{}{父亲，你别跟我说我当初该怎么做。现在我是可汗，你不过是滩烂肉。}
{117}{}{我还活着。}
{118}{}{当初你刚生下来的时候我就该把你弄死。}
{119}{}{的确是这样，现在才想起来已经太迟了。我已经是死亡之手伽尔，统领整个可汗帮的人。当初你就该进棺材了，现在也一样该死。}
{120}{}{我不相信我居然还能看到你站在我面前。你想怎么样？}
{121}{}{我要你们放了那个女孩。马上！}
{122}{}{我要你放弃头领的位子。}
{123}{}{我要能带我进天堂的财宝。}
{124}{}{你要发誓你马上就会回坟墓里去。}
{125}{}{我发誓我会走的。}
#{125}{}{I swear that I will leave.}
#{126}{}{So be it. Release the Shady Sands woman and escort
# this one out of here . . .}
#{127}{}{You don't rule here. You don't belong here. Death
# to the walking dead!}
#{128}{}{Never!}
#{129}{}{That's what I like. Initiative. But you should not have
# killed them without my orders. I don't like too much
# initiative.}
#{130}{}{What do you want?}
#{131}{}{I want you to set the girl free.}
#{132}{}{I want you to die.}
#{133}{}{I've come in peace to negotiate the release of Tandi.}
#{134}{}{Hngh!}
#{135}{}{What makes you think I have her?}
#{136}{}{I know you do. I followed you here.}
#{137}{}{One of your followers told me.}
#{138}{}{I know.}
{126}{}{那就这样吧，放了那个沙荫镇的女人，护送这个人……离开……}
{127}{}{在这你说了不算。你根本不属于这里。僵尸死人头！}
{128}{}{决不！}
{129}{}{我就喜欢这样。独立主动。但你不该没接到我的命令就杀了他们。我可不喜欢不太听话的人。}
{130}{}{你想怎样？}
{131}{}{我要你放了那女孩。}
{132}{}{我要你死。}
{133}{}{我是来和平谈判怎么释放坦蒂的。}
{134}{}{吼啊！}
{135}{}{谁说她在我这儿了。}
{136}{}{我说的。我跟踪你到这的。}
{137}{}{你手下说的。}
{138}{}{我知道。}
#{139}{}{I hate it when they do that. I will have to make that
# loudmouth pay for his crimes. After I finish up with you.}
#{140}{}{Hmmm. Well, then. What do you offer for her release?}
#{141}{}{I represent a threat you don't even understand. Do you really
# want to risk our wrath.}
#{142}{}{I will give you something of equal value.}
#{143}{}{It would be good for your eternal soul.}
#{144}{}{Your blood, spilled on the ground.}
#{145}{}{Hmmm. For some reason, I believe you. You may take the
# girl, but do not return unless you seek our wrath.}
#{146}{}{Ha! You should not threaten your betters.}
#{147}{}{It must be valuable indeed. Show me.}
#{148}{}{It pleases me. You may take the girl, but do not return.}
#{149}{}{Your bribe is not worth my time. Kill him.}
#{150}{}{You think a man such as I believes in the afterlife?
# This world is dying, and I shall take what I want!
# You will never realize the strength required to make
# such a decision!}
{139}{}{我就恨他们干这事。那个大嘴巴会为这个付出代价的，不过这之前我要把你料理完。}
{140}{}{恩，也好。那你拿什么来作为交换。}
{141}{}{你连我的威胁都听不懂？你当真想和我拼命？}
{142}{}{我会给你等价交换。}
{143}{}{这样能净化你的灵魂。}
{144}{}{你的血，会撒在地上。}
{145}{}{哎……不知道为什么，我竟然相信你。你可以带那女孩走，别再回来了，除非你想拼命。}
{146}{}{哈！你不该威胁比你强大的人。}
{147}{}{那一定很值钱。给我看看。}
{148}{}{恩，我很满意。你可以带女孩走了，不准再回来。}
{149}{}{凭这么点儿就想买通我？杀了他！}
{150}{}{你觉得象我这样的人会相信鬼神吗？整个世界都要毁了，我做坏事还有什么好怕的！你不觉得你做这样的决定太不自量力了吗？}
{151}{}{现在又想怎样？}
#{151}{}{What do you want now?}
#{152}{}{Nothing.}
#{153}{}{I want the girl.}
#{154}{}{Lorrk.}
#{155}{}{Then you disturb me. Leave.}
#{156}{}{You are barely tolerated by us. Why should we give
# one of our most prized possessions to you?}
#{157}{}{It is only right.}
#{158}{}{I have something of equal value.}
#{159}{}{You will be allowed to live.}
#{160}{}{Right?! I determine what is right around here. You
# are treading on dangerous ground.}
#{161}{}{I'm sorry.}
#{162}{}{Why should I care? I'm taking the girl.}
#{163}{}{Yes, indeed you are. I don't tolerate frightened
# curs that have no backbone. And what we don't
# tolerate, we destroy. Kill him.}
#{164}{}{Would you be willing to fight me over her?}
#{165}{}{No, I'm a lover, not a fighter.}
#{166}{}{Of course. Right now, just you and me.}
#{167}{}{I'll take you and your whole gang on.}
#{168}{}{Fine. We shall settle this with no weapons. Knock me
# out, and I'll let you take the woman and leave. I
# knock you out, you leave without her.}
#{169}{}{Fine.}
{152}{}{没事}
{153}{}{那个女孩。}
{154}{}{哦恶。}
{155}{}{那就别烦我了，没事走开。}
{156}{}{你可快把我们惹烦了。我们为什么要把手上最值钱的东西给你？}
{157}{}{因为这样才是正确的。}
{158}{}{我有一样值钱的东西。}
{159}{}{那样你才能被准许活下去。}
{160}{}{正确？在这地盘上对不对我说了算。你要有麻烦了。}
{161}{}{对不起。}
{162}{}{我干嘛要在乎？我这就带女孩走。}
{163}{}{哦，是吗？没骨气却还要吓人的家伙我是最不能忍的。对于我们不能忍的，我们就要毁了它。宰了他。}
{164}{}{你愿意因为她跟我打架？}
{165}{}{不，我是个有爱心的好人，不是个战士。}
{166}{}{当然。就现在，单挑。}
{167}{}{我要你和你的小跟班们一起上。}
{168}{}{好。我们都别用武器。打倒我你就可以带这女人离开。如果我赢了你就得一个人滚。}
{169}{}{好的。}

#{170}{}{This will be interesting, but not very sporting.
# Very well, let's do it.}
#{171}{}{OK.}
#{172}{}{Hmm, you fight better then I expected. I haven't
# had a good beating since my father slapped me
# around the room. You deserve the Shady Sands
# woman. Take her and leave. I wouldn't come back.}
#{173}{}{Take your miserable hide and leave. If you ever
# return, I will not be so gentle.}
#{174}{}{What do you want?}
#{175}{}{I'm an explorer.}
#{176}{}{I want to join.}
#{177}{}{We don't like those kind of people. We can't have that
# here. Kill him.}
#{178}{}{You? Want to join us? Whatever for?}
#{179}{}{To kick some serious ass.}
#{180}{}{I like you guys. I want to bond with you.}
#{181}{}{The Raiders only accept the meanest and toughest SOBs
# around. You have to be bloodthirsty, violent, extreme.
# I don't think you can handle that. Can you?}
#{182}{}{Yes.}
#{183}{}{No.}
{170}{}{虽然这挺有趣，不过也就是动动筋骨。很好，开始吧。}
{171}{}{好。}
{172}{}{哼，你比我想象的能打。上次这么挨打还是我父亲抽的我满屋飞的时候。这个沙荫镇的女人是你应得的。带她走吧。我不反悔。}
{173}{}{你也别装了，快走吧。要是你再回来的话，可别怪我不客气。}
{174}{}{你要干嘛？}
{175}{}{我是个探险者。}
{176}{}{我想入伙。}
{177}{}{我们不喜欢那种人。这里不该有这种人。杀了他。}
{178}{}{你？你想加入我们？为什么？}
{179}{}{为了可以把人揍到鼻青脸肿。}
{180}{}{我喜欢你们这种家伙。想跟你们混。}
{181}{}{我们只接受最邪恶强壮的渣滓。你必须嗜血，暴力，极端。我可不认为你应付的来。}
{182}{}{是的。}
{183}{}{不。}
{184}{}{那你最好离开。我不会回去的。}
#{184}{}{Then you had better leave. I would not return.}
#{185}{}{I grow tired of these women. Kill them.}
#{186}{}{No!}
#{187}{}{OK.}
#{188}{}{You have proved my point. Only the Raiders posses
# the will to survive! You do not. Kill him.}
#{189}{}{You have proved my point. Only the Raiders posses
# the will to survive! You do not. Kill her.}
#{190}{}{Scum! You will pay for that!}
#{191}{}{Ha! I like your style. A little sloppy, but it works.
# Consider yourself a friend of the Raiders. Leave my
# sight now.}
#{192}{}{What do you want now?}
#{193}{}{Nothing.}
#{194}{}{I want some weapons and armor.}
#{195}{}{Grawp.}
{185}{}{我玩厌那些女人了，杀了她们。}
{186}{}{不！}
{187}{}{好的。}
{188}{}{你证明了我的话。只有强盗才有生存意志，你没有。杀了他。}
{189}{}{你证明了我的话。只有歹徒才有生存意志，你没有。杀了她。}
{190}{}{人渣！你会付出代价的。}
{191}{}{哈，我喜欢你的调调。有点懒散，不过还会努力。你可以认为自己是强盗的朋友。现在快走吧。}
{192}{}{现在又要怎样？}
{193}{}{没什么。}
{194}{}{我要武器和装备。}
{195}{}{哇。}
#{196}{}{You must fend for yourself.}
#{197}{}{How dare you return to my sight? Kill him!}
#{198}{}{How dare you return to my sight? Kill her!}
#{200}{}{I came to party with you guys!}
#{201}{}{Well go get some more booze and women for our party.}
#{203}{}{I'll fight you one-on-one for Tandi.}
#{204}{}{You're no Raider, you deserve no honor.}
#{205}{}{Your bribe is not worth my time. Kill her.}
#{206}{}{We don't like those kind of people. We can't have that
# here. Kill her.}
#{207}{}{Waaaug!}
#{208}{}{Ok, you win. Take the girl and get out of here.}
{196}{}{你得自食其力。}
{197}{}{你居然敢回来！杀了他！}
{198}{}{你居然敢回来！杀了她！}
{200}{}{我是来参加你们的。}
{201}{}{那就再为我们找点酒跟女人。}
{203}{}{为了坦蒂，我跟你单挑。}
{204}{}{你根本不算什么可汗，也没什么荣耀可言。}
{205}{}{凭这点就想收买我。杀了她！}
{206}{}{我们不喜欢这种人。这里不允许他们出现。杀了她。}
{207}{}{哇呀呀呀！}
{208}{}{好吧，你赢了。带那女人离开这。}

{1103}{}{烂透了的小地方。我可以轻松扫平他们。}
{1104}{}{他们在南边，我们经常和他们做买卖。多数是买卖水的装备，不过有时也买卖武器。}
