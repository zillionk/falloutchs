#{164}{}{What did you do once you got past the robots?}
{164}{}{摆平了机器人后你们都做了什么？}
#{165}{HROLD20}{

{168}{}{然后呢？}
#{169}{HROLD22}{
#One of them robots got Francine.  Mark was wounded, sent him back to the surface.  Then it was just me and Grey.}

{170}{}{马克后来怎样了？}
#{171}{}{What happened then?}
{171}{}{然后呢？}
#{172}{HROLD23}{
#To this day, I don't know.  He never made it back here, and...well I...couldn't face the wasteland again, so I...I never looked.}

{173}{}{那你和格瑞呢？}
#{174}{HROLD24}{
#We made it to some sort of central core, like a plant of some sort.  That's when it happened.}
{174}{HROLD24}{我们来到了基地中心，有点像厂房的样子。然后不幸发生了。}
#{175}{}{What?}
{175}{}{什么？}
#{176}{HROLD25}{
#A robot crane crashed into us.  Last I saw of Grey, he was flying through the air in-into some sort of acid bath.  I was in bad shape and...well I passed out.}

#{180}{}{Yeah, I can tell.}
{180}{}{我也看出来了。}
#{181}{HROLD26}{
#Well, I have no idea.  Woke up in the wasteland, barely hanging on.  Got lucky and some traders I knew found me days later.  Good thing, since I was already changing.  They brought me here, and here I've been since.}
{181}{HROLD26}{好吧，我不知道。我是在废土中醒来的，还剩一口气。幸运的是一些商人认出了我，救了我。真是很幸运，我那时候就开始变异了，居然也还有人认识我。他们把我带来这里，我就一直住在这里了。}

#{189}{}{How did you survive?}
{189}{}{你怎样幸免于难的？}
#{190}{HROLD28}{
#All's I know, is it was something inside that base.}
{190}{HROLD28}{据我所知，是基地里的某种东西。}
#{191}{}{Do you think it could have been radiation?}
{191}{}{你觉得是辐射吗？}
#{192}{}{Sorry, tough break. Thanks for the story.}
{192}{}{抱歉，休息一下吧。谢谢你的故事。}
#{193}{HROLD29}{
#How the hell should I know?  Grey would've known if anybody could. 【sigh】 Anyway, that's how the deal went down.}

#{194}{}{Thanks for the story.}
{194}{}{谢谢你的故事。}
#{195}{HROLD30}{
#Yeah, about a century or two in dog years.}

#{196}{}{What?}
{196}{}{什么？}
#{197}{HROLD31}{
#Nevermind, that was from my time.  I'm cranky, old and I've been that way ever since I changed.}
{197}{HROLD31}{哦，别介意，那是我对时间的算法。自从我变异后就一直是这么烦躁不安、顽固怪癖了。}
#{198}{}{What did you do before this happened to you?}
{198}{}{你出事之前你在做什么？}
#{199}{HROLD32}{
#Well, I got mutated.  Sure wasn't born this ugly.  Happened when we tried to find out where all the mutants were coming from.}
{199}{HROLD32}{啊，我变异了。我出生时没这么难看。当我们寻找变种人的源头时，我出事了。}
#{200}{}{What happened?}
{200}{}{出了什么事？}
#{201}{HROLD33}{
#It's in the past.  Probably should stay that way.}
{201}{HROLD33}{很久了。就这样吧。}

{233}{HROLD47}{好的。呃，它看起来就像一个大个子的人，就是这样。角和爪子能破坏最厚的装甲。不要被它的体型骗了，它的速度也很快。}
#{234}{}{Any weaknesses?}
{234}{}{有什么弱点？}
#{235}{HROLD49}{Well, from what I've heard, maybe whack it in the head?  I'd try the eyes.  'Course, there's a problem there.}

#{236}{}{What kind of problem?}
{236}{}{什么难题？}
#{237}{HROLD50}{You can't look at 'em!  It is said the Death Claw can hypnotize just by lookin'.  Then it walks up and "boom", you're et!}
