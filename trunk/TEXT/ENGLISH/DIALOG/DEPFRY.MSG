{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see Deputy Fry.}
{100}{}{你看见代理警长佛莱。}
#{101}{}{Hello friend. Deputy Tony Fry at your service.}
{101}{}{你好，代理警长托尼・佛莱为你效劳。}
#{102}{}{What is this place?}
{102}{}{这是什么地方？}
#{103}{}{Get out of my way or they'll have to plant you six feet under.}
{103}{}{从我面前滚开，否则他们会把你砸扁！}
#{104}{}{I didn't do it.}
{104}{}{我不会这么做。}
#{105}{}{Nice to meet you.  Bye.}
{105}{}{见到你很高兴，再见。}
#{106}{}{Wug.}
{106}{}{呜。}
#{107}{}{Ack!}
{107}{}{啊！}
#{108}{}{Oh, a newcomer!  Welcome to the Hub!  I thought you were part of the caravans. Did you come in with them?}
{108}{}{噢，新来的！欢迎来到哈勃城！我还以为你是商队的人。你和他们一块来的吗？}
#{109}{}{Yes.}
{109}{}{是的。}
#{110}{}{No.}
{110}{}{不。}
#{111}{}{I'm not surprised.  Most of the new members of our city come in with the caravans, even with the missing caravans we've had. It's a fine city, but be careful who you associate with.  People like Decker and his thugs can get you into a lot of trouble.}
#{111}{}{我并不感到惊讶。大部份刚到这个城镇的人都是和商队一块，甚至是和我们失踪的商队。这是个不错的城镇，但要注意和谁打交道，像德克和他手下那帮人会给你带来麻烦。}
#{112}{}{Who's Decker?}
{112}{}{谁是德克？}
#{113}{}{Missing Caravans?}
{113}{}{失踪的商队？}
#{114}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{114}{}{好的，谢谢。}
#{115}{}{That's surprising.  It's been pretty rough out there, especially with the missing caravans. But you're safe now, just stay away from the Maltese Falcon. They're a bunch of trouble makers, Decker and his crew.}
{115}{}{真令人惊讶。外面环境恶劣，特别是和失踪的商队一块。但你现在安全了，马耳他猎鹰保持距离，德克和他的手下总是惹麻烦。}
#{116}{}{Who's Decker?}
{116}{}{谁是德克？}
#{117}{}{Missing Caravans?}
{117}{}{失踪的商队？}
#{118}{}{Yeah, well, I'm pretty rough.}
{118}{}{是啊，我很倒霉。}
#{119}{}{Guess so.  So did you have any other questions?}
{119}{}{我猜也是，你还有什么问题吗？}
#{120}{}{Who's Decker?}
{120}{}{谁是德克？}
#{121}{}{What was that about missing caravans?}
{121}{}{失踪的商队发生了什么？}
#{122}{}{That's it, thanks.}
{122}{}{就这样，谢谢。}
