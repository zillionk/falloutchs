#{100}{}{You see Darrel.}
{100}{}{你看见达雷尔。}
#{101}{}{You see a Paladin.}
{101}{}{你看见一名骑士。}
#{102}{}{Greetings, and welcome to the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{102}{}{你好，欢迎来到钢铁兄弟会。}
#{103}{}{Duh...}
{103}{}{咄．．．}
#{104}{}{What is the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{104}{}{什么是钢铁兄弟会？}
#{105}{}{Do you know where I can find a Water Chip?}
{105}{}{你知道在哪儿能找到一块净水芯片吗？}
#{106}{}{Do you know anything about the missing caravans?}
{106}{}{对于失踪的商队你知道些什么吗？}
#{107}{}{Nevermind.}
{107}{}{没什么。}
#{108}{}{Laughs at you) Friend, I don't think you have a chance of getting in here. The Elders have a minimum IQ requirement for new Initiates.}
{108}{}{【对着你笑】朋友，我认为你没机会进来了，长老们对于新来的人有最低限度的智商上的要求。}
#{109}{}{Yes..a..well..a..No. It's just people don't even try to understand what we're all about.}
{109}{}{对，好吧，啊！不！其实人们甚至不去试着了解我们究竟是怎么回事。}
#{110}{}{The Brotherhood is a collective of men and women who have dedicated their lives to the preservation of technology.}
{110}{}{钢铁兄弟会是一群有志于保存技术知识的男女组成的团体。}
#{111}{}{I've heard that you people sacrifice puppies.}
{111}{}{我听说你们把小动物拿来做献祭。}
#{112}{}{What type of armor is that your wearing.}
{112}{}{你穿的是什么类型的装甲？}
#{113}{}{How do I find out more about your technology.}
{113}{}{我怎样才能知道你们更多的技术知识。}
#{114}{}{Good bye.}
{114}{}{再见！}
#{115}{}{No...I never even heard of one of those. One of our head scribes may know. Maybe you can ask one of them. That is if you join us.}
{115}{}{不！我从未听说过这些事，我们某个资深的研究员也许知道，如果你加入我们的话，你可以去问问他们。}
#{116}{}{Join? How do I join?}
{116}{}{加入？我如何加入？}
#{118}{}{You guys don't know jack.}
{118}{}{你们这些家伙到底是兄弟会还是整人会啊。}
#{119}{}{Sacrifice puppies!!! Where the hell did you hear that one? Don't believe everything you hear in the wastes they're all a bunch of pathetic lunatics.}
{119}{}{拿小动物献祭！！！你究竟是从哪儿听说这些的？不要相信任何你从废土上听到的任何事，那儿的人全是一群可悲的疯子。}
#{120}{}{Actually I thought it would have been kinda cool.}
{120}{}{事实上我觉得这个有点酷！}
#{121}{}{Sorry to have upset you.}
{121}{}{抱歉错怪了你。}
#{122}{}{Everyone is a lunatic outside the Brotherhood of Steel?}
{122}{}{兄弟会以外的人都是疯子吗？}
#{123}{}{The only way to know anything more about us, is to join us. My friend Cabbot can help you with that.}
{123}{}{想更多的了解我们的唯一途径，就是加入我们。我朋友卡波特能帮助你。}
#{125}{}{Do you have a Water Chip in the Brotherhood?.}
{125}{}{在兄弟会里面有净水芯片吗？}
#{126}{}{You'll need to speak with Cabbot about that.}
{126}{}{关于这些你须要和卡波特谈谈。}
#{127}{}{What is the Brotherhood of Steel all about anyway?}
{127}{}{总之，兄弟会究竟是做什么的？}
#{128}{}{That's OK...It's just people don't even try to understand what we're all about.}
{128}{}{简单的说，这仅仅是人们不去试着了解我们到底是做什么的。}
#{129}{}{What's there to understand?}
{129}{}{那儿有什么要了解的？}
#{130}{}{Well?... I think you guys just might be a little kookie myself.}
{130}{}{好吧，我个人认为你们这些家伙有些奇特。}
#{131}{}{Technology. That is all that any one needs to understand. Join us and you will come to know this.}
{131}{}{技术，那是每个都须要知道的，加入我们你将会了解到这些。}
#{132}{}{How does one join the Brotherhood?}
{132}{}{一般人怎样才能加入兄弟会？}
#{133}{}{You people are a little too left field for me.}
{133}{}{你们对于我来说真有点不太好理解。}
#{134}{}{I'm sorry you feel that way.}
{134}{}{我很抱歉你有这样的感受。}
#{135}{}{This is Powered Combat Infantry Armor model T-51b or more commonly know as Power Armor.}
{135}{}{这是由动力推动的战斗步兵装甲模型Ｔ－５１ｂ，或者更通俗的说，这是动力装甲。}
#{136}{}{I've been wanderin' the wastes for weeks for weeks now and I've never seen armor like this before.}
{136}{}{我在废土上游荡了一周又一周，却从未见这样的装甲。}
#{137}{}{It looks like it would be cumbersome to wear.}
{137}{}{看起来穿着它挺笨重的。}
#{139}{}{The Brotherhood are the sole bearers of the Power Armor in the wastes. Only the honored, and Knights of the highest Stature are given the privilege to wear the ultimate armor.}
{139}{}{兄弟会是废土上动力装甲的唯一拥有者，只有被特许的，并拥有最高声望的骑士才有权穿上这套终极战甲。}
#{140}{}{That still doesn't answer why I've never seen it before.}
{140}{}{这仍然未解释为什么我以前从未见过它。}
#{141}{}{How does one join the Brotherhood?}
{141}{}{一般人怎样才能加入兄弟会？}
#{143}{}{Heathens have tried and failed to take our Power Armor from us. They would have to kill a Brother to possess his birthright, and if it comes to that, the armor would be in such poor condition as to render it useless.}
{143}{}{一些野蛮人曾经尝试从我们这儿得到动力装甲，他们失败了。他们不得不杀了一位我们的兄弟以拥有它，如果那样的话，这套装甲将沦落到使它毫无价值的可悲的境地。}
#{144}{}{I think I'll try to take it off your dead cold body.}
{144}{}{我想我要把它从你冰凉的尸体上扒下来。}
#{145}{}{Bye.}
{145}{}{拜拜！}
#{146}{}{Do I have to sacrifice a puppie to join?}
{146}{}{我必须献祭一只小动物才能加入吗？}
#{147}{}{Cumbersome? Not in the least. The sacred armor is so finely constructed to such exacting specifications that it feels like an extension of the blessed one's own body. It increases one's strength many times over and helps you resist the effects of radiation so that you may more effectively serve the brotherhood. I would feel diminished without my holy armor.}
{147}{}{笨重？一点儿也不！这套神圣的装甲是如此细致的按照最严格的规范制造，穿着它就好像自己身体的扩展一样，它能极大的增加使用者的力量，并能抵抗辐射的作用，这样才能更好的为兄弟会服务。没有了这神圣的装甲我就觉得变得虚弱了。}
#{148}{}{How come no one else in the wastes has this armor.}
{148}{}{怎么会废土上没有其它人有这个装甲。}
#{149}{}{I want one of those.}
{149}{}{我想要一套。}
#{151}{}{You need to speak with Cabbot if you wish to join.}
{151}{}{如果你想加入的话得去和卡波特谈谈。}
#{152}{}{I can't believe it. They're sending him down there?}
{152}{}{我不敢相信，他们要让他下到那儿去？}
#{153}{}{I can't believe it. They're sending her down there?}
{153}{}{我不敢相信，他们要让她下到那儿去？}
#{154}{}{So you took the Famous Glow Quest. (Laughs)}
{154}{}{这么说你接受了那闪光之地的任务。【大笑】}
#{155}{}{No... I'm going to the Ancient Order.}
{155}{}{不．．．我要去古老的建筑。}
#{156}{}{The Glow, what's that?}
{156}{}{闪光之地，那是什么？}
#{157}{}{It's none of your business what I am doing.}
{157}{}{我做什么不关你的事。}
#{158}{}{Yeah, I did. Bye.}
{158}{}{是的，我做了，再见！}
#{159}{}{Glow, Ancient Order it's the same thing. It's still not a good place to visit.}
{159}{}{闪光之地、古老的建筑是一回事。那可不是个观光的好地方。}
#{160}{}{Why do you say that?}
{160}{}{你为何这么说？}
#{161}{}{How hard could it be. All I have to do is go get something and bring it back. It's the old send the new guy on a quest thing.}
{161}{}{这能有多难呢，我所要做的就是去那找到某样东西并把它带回来，这是老手交给新手的任务。}
#{162}{}{Why the two names?}
{162}{}{为什么有两个名字？}
#{163}{}{What's so special about this place.}
{163}{}{这地方有什么特别的吗？}
#{164}{}{The Glow, as it is known to topsiders, was supposedly a place where some of the most advanced weapons of that time were developed. At least that's what it says in the ancient writings. Now as fasr as any of us can tell it's a big crater filled with Rads. I think the Elders send Brotherhood wanabes down there just to get rid of them.}
{164}{}{闪光之地，就像废土上的居民所知道的那样，可能有以前那个发达年代所制造的大部分先进武器，至少在一些古老的记录里是这么说的。而现在我们所知道的就是它是一个充满辐射的大弹坑，我认为长老们把某个兄弟会成员派到那去仅仅是为了除掉他。}
#{165}{}{Others? There was others before me.}
{165}{}{其它人？在我之前还有其它人。}
#{166}{}{I'm going to the Ancient Order. Where's that located.}
{166}{}{我要去古老的建筑，它的位置在哪？}
#{167}{}{Your right. It's not any of my business.}
{167}{}{你说的对，这不关我的事。}
#{168}{}{Well? To start it's a good 10 days travel to the Southeast from here. And then there's the radiation. There's a reason none of us have ever gone to the "Ancient Order". If you don't have Rad-X you'll be cooked before you even know what hit you.}
{168}{}{好吧，从这儿往东南方向走大概有１０天的路程，并且那儿充斥着辐射，这也是没人去过”古老建筑“的原因。如果你没有抗辐射药Ｘ的话，在你知道被什么击中之前就会变成北京烤鸭！}
#{170}{}{Let me get this straight...}
{170}{}{我得把这个弄明白．．．}
#{171}{}{Most topsiders think that it is just a big Radioactive hole. Thus the name became the Glow or ome even call it the Hot Spot. We in the Brotherhood know the truth. According to the ancient writings this place was the source of all our technology. And who knows what may still be there.}
{171}{}{大部分上层居民认为那儿仅仅是一个充满辐射的大坑，因此才称它为死亡谷，有些人甚至称它为火辣的地区。我们兄弟会的人才知道真相，通过古老的记录可知这个地方是我们所有技术知识的源泉，天知道那儿还有什么！}
#{173}{}{Let me get this straight...}
{173}{}{我得把这个弄明白．．．}
#{174}{}{Others have tried. We never heard from them again.}
{174}{}{有些人曾去尝试过，可我们以后再也没见过他们。}
#{175}{}{Hell, you've almost talked me out of even wanting to join the Brotherhood.}
{175}{}{该死，刚才你还想说服我加入兄弟会。}
#{176}{}{They were weak. I'll be seen' you around.}
{176}{}{他们很差劲，我们会再见面的。}
#{177}{}{What should I watch for when I go down there.}
{177}{}{当我下去的时候我该注意些什么？}
#{179}{}{The Glow and the Ancient Order are one in the same.}
{179}{}{闪光之地和古老的建筑是一回事。}
#{180}{}{What is the Glow?}
{180}{}{闪光之地是什么？}
#{181}{}{Don't get me wrong the Brotherhood is a great place to join. It's by far the safest place to live in the wastes. No place else will you find better weapons and armor. We serve technology and technology serves us.}
{181}{}{别误会我的意思，兄弟会是一个值得加入的伟大的地方，到目前为止它是废土上最安全的居住之地，你不会在其它地方找到比这儿更好的武器和装甲，我们服务于科技，而科技也服务于我们。}
#{182}{}{Sounds good, I'll be going on my way.}
{182}{}{听起来不错，我马上就去。}
#{183}{}{What can you tell me about the Glow.}
{183}{}{关于闪光之地你能告诉我些什么。}
#{184}{}{It doesn't sound like it is worth the trouble.}
{184}{}{看起来不值得冒这个险。}
#{185}{}{What?...}
{185}{}{什么？．．．}
#{186}{}{Why does the Ancient Order have two names?}
{186}{}{为什么古老的建筑有两个名字？}
#{187}{}{Where is the Ancient Order, and the dangers are...?}
{187}{}{古老的建筑在哪儿？危险是．．．？}
#{189}{}{Most topsiders think that it is just a big Radioactive hole. Thus the name became the Glow or some even call it the Hot Spot. We in the Brotherhood know the truth. According to the ancient writings this place was the source of all our technology. And who knows what may still be there.}
{189}{}{大部分上层居民认为那儿仅仅是一个充满辐射的大坑，因此才称它为闪光之地，有些人甚至称它为火辣的地区。而我们兄弟会的人知道真相，通过古老的记录可知这个地方是我们所有技术知识的源泉，天知道那儿还有什么！}
#{190}{}{Got another question for you.}
{190}{}{我还有个问题问你。}
#{191}{}{Can I help you?}
{191}{}{要我帮忙吗？}
#{192}{}{Nevermind. Bye.}
{192}{}{没什么，再见。}
#{193}{}{Sure ask away.}
{193}{}{随便问吧。}
#{194}{}{Hello}
{194}{}{你好。}
#{195}{}{Yes, Rutger came here personally not too long ago, and that's not like him. He was trying to find out what had been happening to his caravans. I've no idea what it could have been. A few others say they saw something over near the hub, but it disappeared before they could get close enough. It's all very unnerving, I hope it's resolved soon.}
{195}{}{是的，不久前罗格尔亲自来到这儿，这可不像他的作风！他想查出他的商队究竟发生了什么事情。我不知道究竟是什么回事，有几个家伙说他们在哈伯镇附近看见一些东西，但是在他们靠近之前就消失了。这一切都非同寻常，我希望这个疑团能很快解开。}
#{196}{}{I heard you make animal sacrifices! Maybe you take these caravans for your dark rituals!}
{196}{}{我听说你们用动物来献祭！也许你把商队抓来做黑暗的仪式了。}
#{197}{}{Any suspicions?}
{197}{}{有什么疑点吗？}
#{198}{}{Well, if you see anything let me know. I'd like to get to the bottom of this soon myself.}
{198}{}{那么，如果你知道什么请告诉我，我不久就要独自下到它的底部去了。}
#{199}{}{Not really, but I suspect it's foul play... but then again, there are a lot of strange and dangerous creatures out there in the wastelands. It could simply be some creature, or more likely a herd or band of them. I hope that helps. Good day.}
{199}{}{其实不是这样，我猜这是不公平的竞赛．．．但是再一次地，废土上有很多陌生并且危险的生物，可能仅仅是一些生物，或者是牧群，或是二者的结合。我希望这有些用，祝你愉快！}
#{201}{}{Thanks for your time. Bye.}
{201}{}{谢谢你，占用了你的时间，再见！}
#{202}{}{OK, thanks. Bye.}
{202}{}{好的，多谢，再见！}
#{203}{}{Thanks for the info. Bye.}
{203}{}{谢谢你的消息，再见！}
#{204}{}{Thanks, Bye.}
{204}{}{谢了，再见！}
#{205}{}{Ok... Thanks for the info.}
{205}{}{好吧...谢谢你的消息。}
#{206}{}{I Thank you for the warning. Bye.}
{206}{}{感谢你的忠告，再见！}
#{207}{}{Thank you. Bye.}
{207}{}{谢谢，再见！}
#{208}{}{Thank you for your time.}
{208}{}{谢谢你！}



#{209}{}{If you were lookin' to get a hold of some better arms, maybe you should try the Glow down south. (Darrel points south)}
{209}{}{如果你想得到更好武器装置，也许你该去南边的死亡谷试试【达雷尔指向南方】}
#{210}{}{Here take some Rad-X. (Darrel gives you some pills)}
{210}{}{拿着这些抗辐射药Ｘ【达雷尔给你一些药丸】}
#{211}{}{Swallow these like this. (Darrel motions taking the pills and rubs his tummy). Mmmmm yummm.}
{211}{}{像这样吞下去。【达雷尔拿着药丸比着手势，还揉着他的肚子】阿呜阿呜阿呜．．．}
#{212}{}{Wait, wait, Not yet! (Darrel stops you from taking the pills) Wait until you get to the Glow.}
{212}{}{等等，不是现在，【达雷尔阻止你吞下药丸】等你到了闪光之地再吃！}
#{300}{}{[more]}
{300}{}{【更多】}
