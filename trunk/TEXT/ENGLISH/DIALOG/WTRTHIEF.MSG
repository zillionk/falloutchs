# {113}{}{Have you seen anyone else around here?}
# {114}{}{I'm sorry, but I'm looking for the water thief and I need

# {115}{}{Yeah, some guy was acting suspicious back near the water ration room. He scared me. I hope he didn't see me.}
# {116}{}{What did he look like?}
# {117}{}{I'm sorry, but I still need to see what you're carrying.}
# {118}{}{I didn't get a good look at him because I ran.}
