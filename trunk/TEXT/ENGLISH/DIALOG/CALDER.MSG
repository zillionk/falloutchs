#{100}{}{You see a teenager.}
#{101}{}{You! You did it! When I grow up I'm gonna get you!
# I'm gonna hunt you down and kill you! You killed them
# all! Aaaaaalllll! 【Uncontrolled sobbing】.}
#{102}{}{It was the only way. The only way to stop them.}
#{103}{}{How in Hell did you survive the nuke?}
#{104}{}{It's a lie, kid. I didn't do it!}
#{105}{}{You'd better go find a doctor, kid. You've got radiation sickness.}
#{106}{}{You know kid, I don't need some tough guy trying to take me out twenty years down the road. Say good-night, brat.}
#{107}{}{I heard about you. You run around the Wastes killing kids! Help! Nightkin!}
#{108}{}{You're mistaken, child. I'm a good man.}
#{109}{}{Yeah, and if you don't shut up, you won't live long enough to have nightmares.}
#{110}{}{I ain't here to bother you kid, so just be quiet.}
#{111}{}{I do what? They not just small guys?}
#{112}{}{Okay. I'll be quiet. But I hope the Nightkin get you!}
#{113}{}{Nightkin! Nightkin!}
#{114}{}{Maybe it was someone else. But if it was you, I'll find you one day when I get older, and I'll make you pay!}
#{115}{}{Hello, sir. Do you need a meditation flower?}
#{116}{}{Hello, ma'am. Do you need a meditation flower?}
#{117}{}{Child, has anything interesting happened here lately?}
#{118}{}{Of course, child.}
#{119}{}{Not right now.}
#{120}{}{Flower pretty?}
#{121}{}{Get that weed out of my face, you little brat!}
#{122}{}{I heard Father Morpheus had a visit from the Master himself. He's real happy right now.}
#{123}{}{Anything else?}
#{124}{}{I'll bet.}
#{125}{}{Not right now.}
#{126}{}{Flower pretty?}
#{127}{}{Get that weed out of my face, you little brat!}
#{128}{}{Father Lasher says I have to keep my big mouth shut. He's no fun!}
#{129}{}{C'mon kid. Surely, you've seen something!}
#{130}{}{Father Lasher?}
#{131}{}{Fun good.}
#{132}{}{Sounds like he and I have a lot in common.}
#{133}{}{That's great! May the Master bless you. 【He hands you a flower.】}
#{134}{}{Aw! You're no fun. Maybe I should tell the Nightkin about you!}
#{135}{}{The Nightkin are my friends.}
#{136}{}{You're a little too young to understand how much fun I can be.}
#{137}{}{Go ahead. And I'll tell them about you.}
#{138}{}{You start telling anyone about me, kid, and you're dead!}
#{139}{}{Sure is. I picked it myself from a grove across town. Well, it was nice meeting you. May the Master bless you.}
#{140}{}{What'd I do? What'd I do?!}
#{141}{}{Are you sure you don't want a flower?}
#{142}{}{I'll take it if you tell me what's going on around here.}
#{143}{}{Fine. I'll take it.}
#{144}{}{Sorry kid. I'm not a flower kinda guy.}
#{145}{}{Sorry kid. You're a little too young to be giving me flowers.}
#{146}{}{I dunno. Why you ask?}
#{147}{}{I can't tell you that! The Nightkin would eat me!}
#{148}{}{He's my teacher. He says every lash we receive brings us closer to the Master!}
#{149}{}{What a charming man. We really must talk.}
#{150}{}{Don't believe him kid.}
#{151}{}{Where is this bastard? I'll kill him.}
#{152}{}{Teacher? What need teacher?}
#{153}{}{And you still haven't learned when to shut up? You must have dung for brains, kid.}
#{154}{}{Uh, bye!}
#{155}{}{Yeah. It is. Well good-bye_ ur_ may the Master bless you!}
#{156}{}{But the Nightkin like me! They told me that if anyone bothered me, they'd kill 'em. So there!}
#{157}{}{I heard there's a secret passage around here, but I haven't
# found it yet. Supposed to be real dangerous. Only
# Morpheus and the Nightkin are allowed there.
# Well, I'd better go. Praise the Master!}
#{158}{}{That's too bad. May the Master bless you anyway.}
#{159}{}{Please don't tell him I said anything to you! Please!}
#{160}{}{Don't worry. When I'm through with him, he won't remember a thing.}
#{161}{}{I won't. I promise.}
#{162}{}{Mind your own business, kid.}
#{163}{}{Rar! What you say?}
#{164}{}{Life is tough. Learn to take it, kid, and quit whining.}
#{165}{}{But I must! I must! Disbelief is pain!}
#{166}{}{Please don't! He loves me! He's the only one who does.}
#{167}{}{That's okay, I guess. May the Master bless you. Bye.}
#{168}{}{Thank you! Oh thank you! May the Master bless you. Bye.}
#{169}{}{Okay I will . . . (sniff) Maybe Father Lasher will be more kind to me after the Master takes over the world.}
#{171}{}{And when's the Master going to take over the world?}
#{172}{}{Tell me more about this, kid.}
#{173}{}{He won't be. He'll get worse. But if you're smart, make yourself her favorite and he'll let you torture the new kids that come in.}
#{174}{}{Ugh! Me like kindness.}
#{175}{}{Soon, or so they tell me. We're going to have peace, and unity and the Holy Flame will be lit. And maybe Father Morpheus won't be quite so loud, either.}
#{176}{}{Anything else?}
#{177}{}{Father Morpheus?}
#{178}{}{Loud sucks!}
#{179}{}{Uh, I really don't know very much. Honest. Bless the Master! Bye!}
#{180}{}{Hi. How are you?}
#{181}{}{Fine, kid. What's the good news?}
#{182}{}{Okay. So you got any dirt for your old friend?}
#{183}{}{Pretty good. How about you?}
#{184}{}{I dunno. Bored.}
#{185}{}{I feel lousy. Do you know how long it's been since I killed anything?}
#{186}{}{Uh, hello.}
#{187}{}{Hello kid. Can you tell me what this place is about?}
#{188}{}{Hi kid. What're you doing in this joint?}
#{189}{}{Hi kid. How're you doing?}
#{190}{}{Out of my face, brat, or I'll turn you into a belt!}
#{191}{}{Hello? Rhyme with yellow! Funny!}
#{192}{}{This is the Cathedral of the Children of the Cathedral.
# I don't know why they say Cathedral twice. We worship the
# Master, and we yell a lot about Peace and Unity.
# It sounds kind of dumb, but the Master's real smart,
# so I guess it must be okay.}
#{193}{}{Tell me more about the Master.}
#{194}{}{Sounds dumb to me, too. What are you doing here?}
#{195}{}{Don't talk about your elders that way, okay?}
#{196}{}{What kind of a brainwashed little fool are you? You're going to grow up to be one of these zombies! I should kill you now!}
#{197}{}{I give out flowers. Every petal is peace, and the stem is unity. Or are the petals unity and the stem peace? Oh no, I don't remember! Do you want one?}
#{198}{}{I'll take one if you tell me what's going on around here.}
#{199}{}{Sure.}
#{200}{}{No, thanks.}
#{201}{}{Screw peace. Screw unity. And get that flower out of my face!}
#{202}{}{Father Lasher says I shouldn't talk to strangers . . . until we have Unity, of course; then nobody'll be a stranger. Bye!}
#{203}{}{I'm okay. At least until Father Lasher's next lesson.}
#{204}{}{Maybe if you studied harder, the lessons wouldn't be so bad.}
#{205}{}{Tell me more about Father Lasher.}
#{206}{}{What kind of lesson?}
#{207}{}{Stop whining, you little brat, and be grateful that somebody's bothering to teach you!}
#{208}{}{I never do good enough! Never!}
#{209}{}{【done】}

{100}{}{你看见一名少年。}
{101}{}{你！是你干的！我长大后要杀了你！我会找到你，杀掉你！你居然把他们都杀了！啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！【难以自制的哭泣】}
{102}{}{这是唯一的办法，唯一阻止他们的办法。}
{103}{}{你到底是怎么躲过核爆的？}
{104}{}{胡说，小鬼，不是我干的！}
{105}{}{你得看看医生了，孩子，你的辐射不轻啊。}
{106}{}{老弟，我不想看到你追着我２０年都杀不了我，洗洗睡吧。}
{107}{}{我听说过你，你在废土上到处杀小孩！救命啊，夜行团！}
{108}{}{你搞错了，小鬼，我是好人，是好人。}
{109}{}{是我又怎么样，如果你不把嘴闭上，你连做噩梦的机会都没有了。}
{110}{}{我来着没碍你什么事情吧，闭嘴。}
{111}{}{我做了什么？我杀的人不能算小孩了吧？}
{112}{}{好，我不说。但我希望夜行团干掉你！}
{113}{}{夜行团！夜行团！}
{114}{}{也许我认错了，但如果真是你，我长大后会找到你，血债血偿！}
{115}{}{哈罗，先生，你需要一朵冥想用的花么？}
{116}{}{哈罗，姐姐，你需要一朵冥想用的花么？}
{117}{}{孩子，最近这里有什么有趣的事情么？}
{118}{}{当然，孩子。}
{119}{}{现在不要。}
{120}{}{花好看么？}
{121}{}{把你的猪草从我面前拿走，小杂种！}
{122}{}{我听说墨菲斯神父被主教接见了，他现在很高兴。}
{123}{}{还有呢？}
{124}{}{我想也是。}
{125}{}{现在不要。}
{126}{}{花好看么？}
{127}{}{把你的猪草从我面前拿走，小杂种！}
{128}{}{拉舍尔神父说我多嘴，他这个人没意思。}
{129}{}{说点啥嘛，你总看见点什么的。}
{130}{}{拉舍尔神父？}
{131}{}{人要有意思才好。}
{132}{}{我和他倒是有点共识。}
{133}{}{太好了！愿主教赐福你！【给你一枝花】}
{134}{}{呃！你也不好玩。我要去告诉夜行团。}
{135}{}{夜行团是我的哥们儿。}
{136}{}{你太小了，还不知道我有多好玩。}
{137}{}{再说，我把你告诉他们！}
{138}{}{你想告密？小子，你死定了！}
{139}{}{当然了，我是从城外的草地上摘的，很高兴认识你，主教保佑你。}
{140}{}{我该怎么办？我该怎么办！}
{141}{}{你真的不要花？}
{142}{}{如果你告诉我点事儿，我就要你的花。}
{143}{}{好吧，我要了。}
{144}{}{抱歉，小鬼，我不喜欢这种调调儿。}
{145}{}{抱歉，小鬼，你还没到送我花花的年纪呐。}
{146}{}{我不知道，你问这个做什么？}
{147}{}{我不能说，夜行团会吃了我的。}
{148}{}{他是我老师，他说加在我们身上的每一次鞭笞都令我们接近主教！}
{149}{}{这个人太可爱了，我一定要会会他。}
{150}{}{别被他忽悠了，小鬼。}
{151}{}{这个畜生在哪里？我要废了他。}
{152}{}{老师？老师有什么用？}
{153}{}{你可真是漏斗嘴啊，你脑袋里进粪了吧，小鬼。}
{154}{}{呃，再见。}
{155}{}{就这样，再见，主教保佑你！}
{156}{}{夜行团喜欢我！他们说谁要欺负我他们就灭谁，怎么样！}
{157}{}{我知道这附近有个秘道，我也没找到。也许会很危险。只有墨菲斯和夜行团才准去那里。哦，我走了，赞美主教！}
{158}{}{太糟了，希望主教还能保佑你。}
{159}{}{别跟他说是我说的！拜托！}
{160}{}{不用担心，我和他会面后，他就什么也记不住了。}
{161}{}{不会的，我保证。}
{162}{}{少管我的事，小鬼。}
{163}{}{吼吼！你说什么？}
{164}{}{生活是艰难的，学会承受，别怨天尤人的。}
{165}{}{我就要！我就要！没有信仰是痛苦的！}
{166}{}{不要啊！他爱我的！他是唯一爱我的人。}
{167}{}{好吧，愿主教保佑你。再见。}
{168}{}{多谢！多谢！愿主教保佑你！再见。}
{169}{}{好吧，我会……【抽泣】也许主教控制世界后，拉舍尔会对我好一点。}
{171}{}{主教什么时候统治世界？}
{172}{}{告诉我更多，孩子。}
{173}{}{他不会对你好的，只会对你更坏。你要是聪明点，就讨好他，他就会让你糟践那些新来的小鬼。哈哈。}
{174}{}{吼吼！我喜欢好人。}
{175}{}{很快，他们就这么说的。我们就会有和平，统一，圣火会被点燃。那时候，也许墨菲斯神父就不会这么凶了。}
{176}{}{还有呢？}
{177}{}{墨菲斯神父？}
{178}{}{凶恶的人，去死！}
{179}{}{唔，我知道的不多，真的。主教保佑你！拜拜！}
{180}{}{嗨，最近如何？}
{181}{}{很好，孩子，有什么新消息？}
{182}{}{很好，你有没有什么新料要告诉老朋友？}
{183}{}{不赖，你呢？}
{184}{}{我也不知道，好无聊。}
{185}{}{无聊透了，好久没大开杀戒了……}
{186}{}{呃，哈罗。}
{187}{}{哈罗，小鬼，这里是什么地方？}
{188}{}{嗨，小鬼，你在这里做啥？}
{189}{}{嗨，小鬼，过的怎样？}
{190}{}{滚开，小杂碎，信不信我把你打成烂肉！}
{191}{}{哈罗，啊罗，哈罗，啊罗，好玩！}
{192}{}{这里是大教堂，大教堂。我也不知道为什么要说两遍大教堂。我们信仰主教大人，呼唤和平和统一。看起来有点老调，但主教真的很了不起，所以我觉得挺好。}
{193}{}{说说你们的主教。}
{194}{}{我也觉得老土，你在这里做什么？}
{195}{}{别藐视你的上级，知道吗？}
{196}{}{你是个被洗脑的笨蛋，你长大后会变僵尸的！杀了你算了。}
{197}{}{我送花，每片花瓣象征和平，花茎象征统一。不对……花茎象征和平，花瓣象征统一？哎呀，不记得了，你要花吗？}
{198}{}{如果你给我说说这里的事情，我就要一朵。}
{199}{}{好啊。}
{200}{}{不用，谢谢。}
{201}{}{狗屁和平，狗屁统一，把你的猪草从我脸上拿走！}
{202}{}{拉舍尔神父说我不能与陌生人讲话……除非我们实现统一了。那时候谁都不是外人了，再见。}
{203}{}{还好，至少在拉舍尔下次给我上课之前还算好。}
{204}{}{你用点功啊，下次上课就没那么难熬了。}
{205}{}{说说这位拉舍尔神父。}
{206}{}{什么课？}
{207}{}{别哭哭啼啼的，小鬼，你这样不被扁才是万幸呢。}
{208}{}{我怎么用功都不够好！永远不够好！}
{209}{}{【完成】}
