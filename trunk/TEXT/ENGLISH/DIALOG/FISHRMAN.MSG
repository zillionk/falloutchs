#{100}{}{You see a weary fisherman.}
#{101}{}{Sir, I've heard about you, and I'd appreciate it if you left me and my boy in peace.}
#{102}{}{Ma'am, I've heard about you, and I'd appreciate it if you left me and my boy in peace.}
#{103}{}{Howdy sir. I don't often see strangers in this spot. Is there something I can do for you?}
#{104}{}{Howdy ma'am. I don't often see strangers in this spot. Is there something I can do for you?}
#{105}{}{You wouldn't happen to know where I could find a water chip, would you?}
#{106}{}{You wouldn't know anything about mutant armies, would you?}
#{107}{}{Where do you come from?}
#{108}{}{How's the fishing?}
#{109}{}{Give me everything you've got or I'll kill you!}
#{110}{}{Runk!}
#{111}{}{Wait a minute, aren't you that fella who wanders the wastes and kicks the monsters' butts? Can I help you?}
#{112}{}{What a minute, aren't you that filly who wanders the wastes and kicks the monsters' butts? Can I help you?}
#{113}{}{I'm running a little low on supplies . . .}
#{114}{}{No man's ever called me inhospitable, and I don't want to repeat what women call me, but I am trying to fish and I need absolute quiet to catch the damn things, so please try to keep quiet.}
#{115}{}{Has anyone ever told you that you ramble on?}
#{116}{}{Okay.}
#{117}{}{I'm looking for information.}
#{118}{}{Do I look like a scavenger to you? Well, maybe I do, but that's because I spend a lot of time in the Wastes trying to teach my boy to fish and be a man.}
#{119}{}{I haven't done any scavenging in six years. Too many Rad Scorpions. A fella could get killed out there with all them varmints running around.}
#{120}{}{About eight years ago, I sold some chips in Junktown. I don't know what they did. One of them could have been a water chip, though I wouldn't bet on it.}
#{121}{}{Anyhow, I need quiet for my fishing, so I'd appreciate it if you'd keep quiet and let me get back to work before me and my boy starve.}
#{122}{}{Mutant armies? Not in this spot. Just regular armies would be bad enough, heh heh.}
#{123}{}{You know there's too much politics in the world. I keep telling my boy that these politicians can't wait to blow up the world again. That's why I'm living off the land, to avoid the politicians! Only way to live.}
#{124}{}{Now that's rather personal information there. I've killed men for asking less, just ask the boy. But I think you look like an honest person, so I'll let it slide this time.}
#{125}{}{Well, I've fished this place for the last five years and it keeps getting worse and worse. I think it's Skunk, the three-eyed giant catfish, that keeps scaring everything away from my spot.}
#{126}{}{But I'm gonna get that fish, just you wait. It's getting personal between us, and only one of us is gonna walk away, believe me. I'm more serious than the Brotherhood of Steel about this.}
#{127}{}{Now you'll probably kill me, but if I don't stand up to you, I'll be setting a bad example for the boy. See my dilemma? Why don't you just walk away and make it easier for both of us!}
#{128}{}{I'm not walking away, and you won't be walking at all unless you do what I say.}
#{129}{}{Shut up and die!}
#{130}{}{Fine. I'll leave you in peace.}
#{131}{}{Son, I think you've been wandering the wastes a little too long.}
#{132}{}{Miss, I think you've been wandering the wastes a little too long.}
#{133}{}{Try some of this.}
#{134}{}{Try some of . . . oh damn, where did I put it . . .}
#{135}{}{Well, I heard about a big Vault way to the East, and reports of a secret Vault somewhere down south. And there may be some chips in Junktown and the Hub. Hope that helps.}
#{136}{}{I hate to be inhospitable, but I need quiet for my fishing, so I'd appreciate it if you'd keep quiet and let me get back to work before me and my boy starve. And good luck killing those varmints.}
#{137}{}{Mutant armies? Just plain armies would be bad enough. I heard tell that someone's been harassing the ghouls over in Necropolis, but that was a while ago.}
#{138}{}{Now that's a personal question. My mother's womb, of course, but that's a little too flip. I don't have a home no more. Me and my boy just wander and try to survive.}
#{139}{}{I do know where some caches are stored, but that's my secret.}
#{140}{}{Well, it's kill or be killed - the Law of the Wastes - out here, but I'll tell you what. You keep killing monsters and I'll give you some supplies.}
#{141}{}{Yeah you are. But what the hell does 'runk' mean? Whatever it is, I hope it's friendly.}
#{142}{}{Now I'm hurt. Here I go, out of my way to be neighborly, and you accuse me of rambling! Well! I don't offend easy, but you just gone and made me mad enough to nuke someone.}
#{143}{}{Anyhow, why don't you just get outta here. Git!}
#{144}{}{Thank you kindly.}
#{145}{}{What do you want to talk about?}
#{146}{}{I'm trying to find a water chip.}
#{147}{}{I'm trying to find out about some mutant armies.}
#{148}{}{What can you tell me about the Brotherhood?}
#{149}{}{What can you tell me about the Boneyard?}
#{150}{}{I'm sorry friend, I don't think I can help you.}
#{151}{}{'Runk' ain't the same as keeping quiet. Now shut yer yap and get outta here.}
#{152}{}{Fine. Take what you want and get out.}
#{153}{}{You really aren't very friendly, are you?}
#{154}{}{You'll forgive me if I ain't more appreciative, but I think you should just leave.}
#{155}{}{I try to avoid them if I can. Their patrols can be pretty nasty if they decide not to take a liking to you.}
#{156}{}{That's down on the coast. I hear stories about gangs running amok and all sorts of things that I don't want the boy to see, so I'm staying away from that place!}
#{157}{}{Now put that thing away before you hurt someone. A man can't have a civil conversation when there are weapons drawn.}
#{158}{}{Son, there's nothing like a battle between a fish and a man.}
#{159}{}{Son, did I ever tell you about the time I caught the giant eel . . .}
#{160}{}{Son, don't talk back to your father!}
#{161}{}{Maybe this time I'll catch that three-eyed catfish.}
#{162}{}{Dinner's coming right up!}
#{163}{}{There's nothing like the taste of a juicy fish on an open fire.}
#{164}{}{Quiet son, you're scaring away the fish.}


{100}{}{你看到一个疲倦的渔民.}
{101}{}{先生，我听说过你，如果你能让我和我儿子安生的呆着，我会感激你的。}
{102}{}{小姐，我听说过你，如果你能让我和我儿子安生的呆着，我会感激你的。}
{103}{}{你好先生。我在这并不经常见到陌生人。我能为你做点什么吗？}
{104}{}{你好小姐。我在这并不经常见到陌生人。我能为你做点什么吗？}
{105}{}{你不知道在哪里能找到净水芯片吗？}
{106}{}{你不知道关于变种军队的事情吗？}
{107}{}{你从哪来的？}
{108}{}{钓多少了？}
{109}{}{把你知道的都告诉我，不然我杀了你！}
{110}{}{垃圾！}
{111}{}{等会，你不是那个反抗怪物在荒野里迷路的小伙子吗？我能帮你吗？}
{112}{}{等会，你不是那个反抗怪物在荒野里迷路的小姑娘吗？我能帮你吗？}
{113}{}{有一点廉价的补给品我就能活的很好……}
{114}{}{不，人们曾经说我太冷淡，我不想重复他们说什么，但是该死的鱼喜欢安静，只有绝对的安静才能钓到它们，所以请你保持安静。}
{115}{}{你和人闲聊过？}
{116}{}{同意。}
{117}{}{我在打听消息。}
{118}{}{我在你眼力就像个捡破烂儿的？也对，也许我就是。那是因为我把所有的时间都耗费在教授我的儿子如何捕鱼，如何在荒野做人上面了。}
{119}{}{６年的时间里我的清理工作也没做完。辐射蝎太多了。怪物横行，生存难啊。}
{120}{}{大约８年以前，我在迦克镇出售一些芯片。我不知道它们是做什么用的。不过其中好象有净水芯片，不过我不能确定。}
{121}{}{总之，我掉鱼需要安静，所以如果你保持安静我会很感激你的。这样我和我的儿子就不会饿死了。}
{122}{}{变种军团？这没有那玩意把。不变种的军团已经够坏了。呵呵。}
{123}{}{你知道这世界上有太多的搞政治的，我不断告诉我的孩子那些政客不会等到下一次世界大爆炸的。要夺回我们赖以生存的土地，就要消灭政客！这是生存唯一的办法。}
{124}{}{现在我们聊点私人的事情。我有个小小的请求，我要杀个人。也许我该问问是那孩子，但我觉的你是个好人，所以我决定忘掉这件事。}
{125}{}{我在这钓了５年的鱼，最近鱼越来越少。我认为都是那些该死的臭鼬, 它们见什么都糟蹋，还吓跑了我的三眼大鲶鱼。}
{126}{}{我这就去钓它，你等着。这是我们之间私人恩怨，不是它死就是我亡，相信我，与钢铁兄弟会相比较，我们对于这件事是比较认真的。}
{127}{}{现在你可以杀我了，但是如果我不反抗你的话,，我将会被我的孩子看做是个孬种。看到我进退两难的局面了吗？为什么你不去散散步让我们之间轻松些呢。}
{128}{}{我不去散步，除此之外你也别想去散步，你明白我的意思吗？}
{129}{}{闭嘴，死把！}
{130}{}{很好。我会安静的离开你的。}
{131}{}{孩子，我认为你在废土里晃悠的时间有点太长了。}
{132}{}{小姐，我认为你在废土里晃悠的时间有点太长了。}
{133}{}{试试这个。}
{134}{}{试……试这……噢！该死，我把它放哪了……}
{135}{}{好的，我听说在东方一个大的避难所，里面有个秘密的文件说在南方的迦克镇和哈勃城有可能有些净水芯片。希望着个消息能帮助你。}
{136}{}{我恨这样冷漠的待客，但是我钓鱼需要安静。所以如果你能在我工作回来，我和我儿子饿死之前保持安静，我会非常感激你的。祝你杀那些怪物的时候好运。}
{137}{}{变种军团？平原那些军队就够坏的了。我听说他们中的一些人不断袭击公墓里的食尸鬼，但那是以前的事情了。}
{138}{}{现在是个私人问题。我妈妈的子宫弹性太小了。一点都不包容我们，我们已经无家可归了。我和我儿子到处流浪勉强生存。}
{139}{}{我知道哪有隐藏的信息。但是那是我的秘密。}
{140}{}{好把，这里不是杀人就是被杀―这就是废土的法律―这就是我要对你说的，不过你要继续杀那些怪物的话，我会给你写补给的。}
{141}{}{呀，是你。你知道“垃圾”的含义吗？不管那是什么，我希望它是友好的。}
{142}{}{我现在受伤了。我要死了，我是出于友好的，可你却不领情！我不想轻易冒犯，但这你逼我的！}
{143}{}{你怎么还不离开这？饭桶！}
{144}{}{感谢。}
{145}{}{你想说什么？}
{146}{}{我正在找净水芯片。}
{147}{}{我正在找那些变种的军团。}
{148}{}{你能告诉我关于钢铁兄弟会的事情吗？}
{149}{}{你能告诉我关于晒骨场的事情吗？}
{150}{}{对不起朋友，我想我帮不了你。}
{151}{}{“垃圾” 就是非常的吵！现在你给我闭嘴，滚！}
{152}{}{非常好，告诉我你想要什么，然后离我远点。}
{153}{}{你真太不友好了！我很生气，后果很严重。}
{154}{}{原谅我把，我确实没眼力见，但是我还是认为你应该离开。}
{155}{}{我想躲他们远点，如果他们不喜欢你，他们就会不断骚扰你。}
{156}{}{在沿海，我听说有一群杀人狂，我可不想让我的孩子遇到，所以我要搬家！}
{157}{}{在我动身之前你要伤害我吗？作为一个男人是不会受到任何的威胁的！}
{158}{}{儿子，世上没有像人和鱼这样的战争！}
{159}{}{儿子，你还记得我捕的那条大鳗鱼吗……}
{160}{}{儿子，别和你爸我顶嘴！}
{161}{}{也许这回我能捉到那只三只眼的鲶鱼。}
{162}{}{晚餐有着落拉！}
{163}{}{世上没有比鲜嫩的鱼更美味的东西了。}
{164}{}{安静儿子，你把鱼吓跑了。}
