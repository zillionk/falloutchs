#{101}{}{You see a stern man in his thirties.}
{101}{}{你看到一个３０多岁冷峻的人。}
#{102}{}{You should know that we don't like strangers here.  What do you want?}
{102}{}{你知道我们不喜欢陌生人，你想干什么？}
#{103}{}{Good day. May I be of some assistance?}
{103}{}{幸会，有需要我帮忙的吗？}
#{104}{}{I'm}
{104}{}{是的。}
#{105}{}{You have the look of someone important.}
{105}{}{你看起来像是个能说上话的人。}
#{106}{}{Can you tell me a little about Adytum?}
{106}{}{你能告诉我一些内城区的事情吗？}
#{107}{}{Can you tell me what's going on here in the Boneyard?}
{107}{}{你能告诉我在曝骨场发生了什么事情？}
#{108}{}{What's the history behind the Regulators?}
{108}{}{管理者的历史是怎样的？}
#{109}{}{Tell me more about the Children and the Followers.}
{109}{}{能说说大教堂教徒和末世论者的故事吗？}
#{110}{}{Where can I find Zimmerman?}
{110}{}{我在哪里可以找到齐默曼？}
#{111}{}{Have a nice day. Thanks.}
{111}{}{祝你好运，再见。}
#{112}{}{Nice enough town. Me an' the Regulators work hard to keep it that way.
# Anyone in particular you want to know about?}
{112}{}{很好的镇子，我和我的管理者们好不容易才把这里搞清净。你想知道本城哪个人物？}
#{113}{}{Who runs Adytum?}
{113}{}{谁管着内城区？}
#{114}{}{Who does trading here?}
{114}{}{谁在这里做买卖？}
#{115}{}{Nothing else, thanks.}
{115}{}{没事了，多谢。}
#{116}{}{Stay out of trouble, got it?
# I'm Caleb, and that's a name for you to remember,
# 'cause I'll be the one comin' after you if you screw up.}
{116}{}{别惹麻烦，明白吗？我是卡勒布，你给我记住这个名字，如果你犯事了，叫这个名字的人会来逮你的。}
#{117}{}{I'm Caleb. I train and organize the Regulators here.}
{117}{}{我是卡勒布，这儿操练组织都归我管。}
#{118}{}{Yah, I guess. You got the Blades up north, a pretty pathetic herd
# of people, and the Gun Runners a little north and a ways to the east
# through the DeathClaw Playground.}
{118}{}{好吧，北边是利刃帮那些可鄙的混球，往北再往东走，穿过死亡爪出没的地方，就是军火商。}
#{119}{}{Also, a ways to the south of here you have the Children of the Cathedral,
# who run a hospital an' a big church. Up a little bit to the north and to
# the east you got the loony Followers of the Apocalypse, who are all peace-types.}
{119}{}{出城往南走是大教堂教徒的地盘，他们有一家医院和一座教堂。往北走再往西是末世论者的图书馆，他们都是安分的人。}
#{120}{}{Stay out of trouble.}
{120}{}{别惹事。}
#{121}{}{You have a good day, too.}
{121}{}{也祝你好运。}
#{122}{}{You back again?}
{122}{}{你又来了？}
#{123}{}{How c'n I help ya', son?}
{123}{}{你要我怎么帮你，小子？}
#{124}{}{What c'n I do fer ya', miss?}
{124}{}{有何能效劳的，小姐？}
#{125}{}{You'd best keep your weapons put away while you're in town.}
{125}{}{在城里晃的时候你最好把你的武器收起来。}
#{126}{}{Guga gu.}
{126}{}{咕咕。}
#{127}{}{Sorry, but I don't have time for you.  Run along.}
{127}{}{抱歉，我没时间，你可以走了。}
#{128}{}{Adytum here's run by Jon Zimmerman. He's an upright fella,
# takes good care o' the town. You should go an' see 'im. Anything else?}
{128}{}{内城区由乔恩・齐默曼管理。他是个正直的人，把那里治理得很好，你应该去见见他。还有事情吗？}
#{129}{}{Tine runs a shop over near the gates. It's down below the little bunker.
# He does all th' tradin' with the Hub and with outsiders like you. Anything else?}
{129}{}{城门附近提恩有个铺子，房子不大。他总揽哈勃还有你这种外来人的生意。还有问题？}
#{130}{}{We are the police force for Adytum. Most folks 'round here know
# enough not to cause any trouble.}
{130}{}{我们是内城区的警察，多数居民知道犯事的下场。}
#{131}{}{I'm in charge of training the Regulators an' makin' sure that the skags are working hard enough, and that no one moves in on us here. Anythin' else?}
{131}{}{我领导管理者，监督城里的懒虫上班，保证没人敢冒犯我们。你还有问题？}
#{132}{}{Well, the Children of the Cathedral all live in this big
# black church-type building. They have some sort of big god,
# an' they go around tryin' to convert people to their cult.}
{132}{}{大教堂教徒们都住在教堂式建筑里。他们有自己的神，还到处宣扬，拉人入教。}
#{133}{}{You'll find him in the big building to the southwest.
# He might be able to put enough sentences together to let you know
# that we're looking for some help with the Blades.}
{133}{}{你可以在西南部的大房子里找到他。也许他能。}
#{134}{}{What's going on with the Blades?}
{134}{}{利刃帮出什么事情了？}
#{135}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{135}{}{我还能问一些其他事情吗？}
#{136}{}{Thanx for the info. Goodbye.}
{136}{}{谢谢你告诉我这些，再见。}
#{137}{}{Sure. What else do you want to know?}
{137}{}{当然可以，你还想知道些什么？}
#{138}{}{They've done something to Zimmerman's half witted son.
# But like I said, go talk to Zimmerman about it.}
{138}{}{他们对齐默曼的智障孩子做了些事情。算了，你还是去问问齐默曼吧。}
#{139}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{139}{}{我还能问一些其他事情吗？}
#{140}{}{All right I get the picture. I'll go talk to Zimmerman.}
{140}{}{好啦，我了解了，我去和齐默曼说。}
#{141}{}{So, Zimmerman gave you the scoop on the Blades. Whatever.
# I'm sure he'll want to know when you've done the job.}
{141}{}{那么，齐默曼和你说了利刃帮的事情了吧。不管怎么说，我想他希望你早点把事情搞定。}
#{142}{}{Where are the Blades?}
{142}{}{利刃帮在哪里？}
#{143}{}{Why haven't you guys taken care of it yourself?}
{143}{}{你们为什么自己不去干？}
#{144}{}{Yeah, I'll be back when the jobs done.}
{144}{}{事情办完后，我再回来找你。}
#{145}{}{They're all to the north of here. You won't be able to miss their stench.
# Anything else?}
{145}{}{他们住在北边的区，你闻着他们的臭味就能找到了。还有事吗？}
#{146}{}{'cause its a waste of our time. I got better things to do
# than get out there and kill a few skags. Take more time showerin'
# up afterwards than dealin' with them. Anything else?}
{146}{}{因为这对于我们来说是浪费时间。我还有比宰一帮子小杂碎们更重要的事情。往往杀他们没废多少时间，回来洗澡却要洗半天。你还有事？}
#{147}{}{So you're back. Go talk to Zimmerman}
{147}{}{你又来了。去和齐默曼聊聊吧。}
