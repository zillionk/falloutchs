# {100}{}{This computer is labeled Atomic Access Computer.}
# {101}{}{There are cables running from the access computer to the warhead behind it.}
# {102}{}{You have armed the warhead. A timer with four minutes has started a countdown.}
# {103}{}{You have disarmed the nuclear warhead.}
# {104}{}{BOOOOOOOOOM! 【You have set off the nuke!】}
# {105}{}{That doesn't seem to be working.}
# {106}{}{The countdown is still going . . . maybe you should cut that red wire.}
# {107}{}{Maybe you need to use the key also.}
# {108}{}{This computer is equipped with a hardware locking device that prevents the arming of the bomb without the proper key.}
# {109}{}{It is impossible the lockpick this heavily secure lock.}
# {110}{}{This computer cannot be repaired.}

{100}{}{这台计算机标签上写着原子控制计算机。}
{101}{}{有电缆从计算机连接到核弹的后面。}
{102}{}{你检查这个核弹，发现上面有一个４分钟的计时器已经开始倒计时了。}
{103}{}{你拆除这个核弹。}
{104}{}{轰．．．．．．隆【你引爆了核弹！】}
{105}{}{那是不能操作的。}
{106}{}{倒计时仍然在继续．．．也许你应该剪断红色电线。}
{107}{}{也许你应该使用别的钥匙。}
{108}{}{这计算机装备了一个硬件锁装置，防止从外部解除这炸弹。}
{109}{}{那锁很结实，开锁工具不可能打开它。}
{110}{}{修理技术对这计算机没用。}
{111}{}{陷阱技术对这计算机没用。}
{112}{}{你没有足够的技能解开安全系统。}
