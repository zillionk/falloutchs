# {100}{}{This is a nuclear warhead.}
# {101}{}{There are cables running from the access computer to the warhead behind it.}
# {102}{}{You have armed the warhead. A timer with four minutes has started a count down.}
# {103}{}{You have disarmed the nuclear warhead.}
# {104}{}{BOOOOOOOOOM! [You have set off the nuke!]}
# {105}{}{That doesn't seem to be working.}
# {106}{}{The count down is still going . . . maybe you should cut that red wire.}
# {107}{}{Maybe you need to use the key also.}
# {108}{}{This is a nuclear warhead. It is controlled by the computer attached by the cables.}
# {109}{}{There is nothing on this nuclear warhead that needs repairing.}
# {110}{}{There is nothing on this nuclear warhead that can be lockpicked.}

{100}{}{这是一个核弹头。}
{101}{}{有些电线从计算机连接到核弹头后面。}
{102}{}{你触发了核弹头的计时装置，上面有个４分钟的计时器已经开始倒计时了。}
{103}{}{你停止了核弹头的计时装置。}
{104}{}{轰．．．．．隆！【你引爆了核弹！】}
{105}{}{那看上去没有作用。}
{106}{}{计时器还在继续倒计时．．．也许你改剪断红色的电线。}
{107}{}{或许你该使用其他的钥匙。}
{108}{}{这是一个核弹头。它被一台计算通过电缆控制着。}
{109}{}{在这个核弹头上没有需要修理的东西。}
{110}{}{开锁工具对这个核弹头没用。}
{111}{}{这是一个非常大的机关，你不能够解除或拆卸它。}
