#{100}{}{You see Smitty.}
{100}{}{你看见施密蒂。}

#{101}{}{You see a large, muscular man.}
{101}{}{你看见一个魁梧的肌肉男。}

#{102}{}{Good day. What can I do for you?}
{102}{}{日安。我能为你做什么？}

#{103}{}{What do you want?}
{103}{}{你要什么？}

#{104}{}{May I ask your name?}
{104}{}{我能请问你的名字吗？}

#{105}{}{I need you to fix these parts for me, so that I can fix your hydroponic farms.}
{105}{}{我需要你为我修这些零件，这样我才能修理你们的营养液农场。}

#{106}{}{I'd like to buy something.}
{106}{}{我想要买些东西。}

#{107}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
{107}{}{我能问你些问题吗？}

#{108}{}{Nothing, thanks. See you around.}
{108}{}{没事，谢谢。回头见。}

#{109}{}{Uhhh . . .}
{109}{}{呃……}

#{110}{}{I'd recommend that you check out Tine's store, just to one side of the gates. I
#don't actually sell anything here; I trade it to Tine or the Hub merchants for goods.}
{110}{}{我建议你去提恩的商店看看，就在大门旁边。我这里并不卖东西，我的东西都是与提恩或者哈勃城的商人交换物品的。}

#{111}{}{Why, everyone just calls me 'Smitty'.
# Probably because I'm the local blacksmith.}
{111}{}{这里的人都叫我“施密蒂”。也许是因为我是这里的铁匠。 }

#{112}{}{Ask away.}
{112}{}{问吧。}

#{113}{}{Where did you get all of your shop equipment?}
{113}{}{你从哪里买你需要的东西？}

#{114}{}{What all do you make here?}
{114}{}{你在这里制造什么？}

#{115}{}{Can you make guns and bullets?}
{115}{}{你能造枪和子弹吗？}

#{116}{}{Nothing else, thanks.}
{116}{}{没事，谢谢。}

#{117}{}{I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you. Try Zimmerman.}
{117}{}{对不起，我想我帮不了你。去和齐默曼谈谈看吧。}

#{118}{}{Sure.}
{118}{}{当然。}

#{119}{}{Why, any competent blacksmith can make his own anvil!
# 'course, I really just sort of learned the craft by practice,
# but I made most of my own tools.}
{119}{}{你不知道吗？任何一个合格的铁匠都能制造自己的铁砧！当然，实际上我也是通过多次的练习才掌握了这门手艺，但我还是可以自己制造大部分的工具。}

#{120}{}{Mostly I make and repair tools and implements here.
# I also fix things for the Hub merchants. With the help of Miles,
# the chemist, I reload bullets from time to time.}
{120}{}{我主要是制造和修理工具和器具什么的。我也为哈勃商人修理东西。有了化学家麦尔斯的帮助，我还可以为子弹填上火药。}

#{121}{}{Well, building guns and making shells takes machining, and I just don't have
# the tools for that. But with the help of Miles, the chemist, I can reload old brass,
# since I can cast bullets.}
{121}{}{制造枪和子弹壳需要机器加工，我没有那种工具。但有了化学家麦尔斯的帮助，我可以为旧的弹壳填上火药，这和我能制造子弹也没什么分别了。}

#{122}{}{Yes, I can fix this. Give me some time.}
{122}{}{没错，我能修这个。给我些时间。}

#{123}{}{Here you are. [Smitty hands you the fixed parts.]}
{123}{}{给你。【施密蒂将修好的零件交给你。】}

#{124}{}{I already fixed the parts. You need to give them to Miles now.}
{124}{}{我已经修好了零件。现在你得把它们交给麦尔斯。}

#{125}{}{Thanks for fixin' the farms. If you ever find yourself a plasma rifle, bring
# it on back here. I know a few tricks that I can pull with the injectors.}
{125}{}{谢谢你修好了农场。如果你找到一把电浆步枪，把它拿回这里来。我可以为你把它稍为改造一下。}

#{126}{}{Well, I have one right here.}
{126}{}{我这里恰巧有一把。}

#{127}{}{So you found yourself a plasma rifle!}
{127}{}{你找到了一把电浆步枪？不错嘛！}

#{128}{}{Hand it over and I'll take a look at it. [Smitty takes a plasma rifle
# from you, pulls out his tools, and starts tinker with it.]}
{128}{}{让我看看它。【拿起你的一把电浆步枪，抓起工具开始对它进行修理。】}

#{129}{}{There, I think that does it. [Smitty hands you back your plasma rifle.]
# Try that out for size.}
{129}{}{我想我已经完成了。【施密蒂把你的电浆步枪还给你。】找个地方试试它吧。}

#{130}{}{Like I said before, if you get yourself a plasma rifle
# and bring it back here, I can tweak it some for you.}
{130}{}{我说过的，如果你把一把电浆步枪拿给我，我可以为你把它改造一下。}

#{131}{}{Good seein' you again. Hope you're doing all right.}
{131}{}{很高兴再次见到你。希望你过得不错。}
