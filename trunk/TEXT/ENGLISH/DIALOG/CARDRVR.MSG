#{100}{}{You see the Caravan Driver.}
#{101}{}{Did you want to return to the Hub? I'll pay you another ４００ scripts.}
#{102}{}{Rutger should be pleased; we made it without any casualties. Did you
# want to come back with us? We're almost ready to go. The pay will be
# another ４００ scripts.}
#{103}{}{That was easier than I expected. Are you coming back with us?
# I'm sure another ４００ scripts would come in handy.}
#{104}{}{That wasn't too bad. If you want to come back with us to the Hub,
# you're welcome to. We'll pay you another ４００ scripts.}
#{105}{}{It's always a shame to lose someone. Rutger isn't going to take
# this well, but we could use your help getting back. Are you interested?
# Pay's still ４００ scripts.}
#{106}{}{Damn! I hate losing good guards. We've got to be more careful
# on our way back. We've got to cover each other. We can't let this
# happen again. I'll pay you another ４００ scripts. Up for it?}
#{107}{}{Are you able to come back to the Hub with us? I can't risk losing
# another guard. The pay's ４００ scripts. What do you say?}
#{108}{}{I really could use your help getting back. Rutger's going to kill
# me and I don't know if I can make it alone. If you're interested, pay's
# still ４００ scripts. So, what do you say?}
#{109}{}{It's going to be a tough trip back going alone. Would you come
# back to the Hub with me for another ４００ scripts?}
#{110}{}{I can't believe we lost both of the other guards. Rutger and
# Butch are going to have my ass.}
#{111}{}{Yes.}
#{112}{}{No.}
#{113}{}{Ug.}
#{114}{}{Great. Let's go.}
#{115}{}{What, are you afraid?}
#{116}{}{Ah, you're missing out on some action.}
#{117}{}{That's okay. I'm sure we can make it back without a problem.
# Thanks for helping us all get here in one piece.}
#{118}{}{That's okay. I understand. It'll be rough with just one guard,
# but we'll make it.}
#{119}{}{Uh, okay. I'm sure I can make it alone.}
#{120}{}{You all right? The trip must have been harder on you than I thought.}
#{121}{}{You on drugs?}
#{122}{}{Maybe I don't want you on my caravan.}
#{123}{}{So did you change your mind? Do you want the job?}
#{124}{}{Yes.}
#{125}{}{No.}
#{126}{}{Ru?}
#{127}{}{Easy money. So, do you want to come back with us to the Hub?
# The pay's the same either way; but then again, so is the danger.}
#{128}{}{So, you up for ６００ more caps? I've got to head back to the Hub.
# Hopefully this'll be another easy one.}
#{129}{}{I knew you'd come back with us. It'll be ６００ caps again. You
# interested?}
#{130}{}{I hate losing someone like that; that's why we pay the big bucks.
# This is a dangerous route. Well, Demetre's expecting us back soon. Pay's
# the same. Do you want to come back with us?}
#{131}{}{You ready for some more action? This time we won't even get a
# scratch! I'll give you ６００ caps for the trip back to the Hub.}
#{132}{}{I know. It's a shame to lose someone, but at least it was in
# battle. You up for another go at it? We're heading back to the Hub.
# Give you ６００ caps again.}
#{133}{}{Damn, I can't believe we lost both of those guards. Demetre's
# going to be pissed. The pay will be the same, but I'm heading back
# soon. So what do you say? You and me kick some butt?}
#{134}{}{Now that was a fight, it's a shame about the other two. Demetre
# won't like these losses but at least we made it. Are you going to be
# accompanying me back the Hub? It will, of course, pay ６００ caps.}
#{135}{}{I love the taste of battle but I hate loosing my troops. Do you
# think you and I can handle them again? I'm heading out soon -- only
# down side is that the pay's the same. Sorry, no compensation.}
#{136}{}{Mug.}
#{137}{}{Okay. I'm sure we'll make it back just fine.}
#{138}{}{I only really need one guard anyhow.}
#{139}{}{Ah, I can take them all on myself.}
#{140}{}{Ah, you're back! You want the job then, right?}
#{141}{}{Arg.}
#{142}{}{Why, hello there. Looking for a job? We could use someone to help
# guard our caravans on the way back to the Hub. The pay's ４００ scripts.}
#{143}{}{Okay.}
#{144}{}{No thanks.}
#{145}{}{Zuk.}
#{146}{}{Why, hello there. Looking for a job? We could use someone to help
# guard our caravans on the way back to the Hub. The pay's ６００ caps, but
# mind you it's normally quite a dangerous trip.}
#{147}{}{Sure.}
#{148}{}{Yek.}
#{149}{}{Let me know if you change your mind. We leave at 1４００ hours.}
#{150}{}{Sorry, you don't look like you're in any shape for caravan duty.}
#{151}{}{If you can't talk straight I can't hire you.}
#{152}{}{If you want a job, lay off the drugs.}
#{153}{}{Did you change your mind about the job?}
#{154}{}{Yes. I'll hire on.}
#{155}{}{Lum?}
#{156}{}{Here's your pay. Let me know if you're coming back with us.}

{100}{}{你看到商队的车夫。}
{101}{}{你想跟我们返回哈勃城吗？我可以再付你４００个瓶盖。}
{102}{}{罗格尔会很高兴的。我们未损一人。你想跟我们回去吗？我们马上就走了。我会再付你４００个瓶盖。}
{103}{}{路上比我想像中要简单。你想跟我们回程吗？我会付你４００个瓶盖。}
{104}{}{一路上还算顺利。如果你想随我们回哈勃城，我们很欢迎，你的薪酬将是４００个瓶盖。}
{105}{}{路上死了人真是麻烦。罗格尔可能会不高兴的，但是我们还是欢迎你一起回去。有兴趣吗？报酬还是４００个瓶盖。}
{106}{}{他妈的，我最不愿意损失能干的保镖。回去路上我们要小心。我们要互相保护，不能再让这种事情发生。我会再给你４００个瓶盖，有兴趣吗？}
{107}{}{你能陪我们回哈勃城吗？我不能再让我的保镖死菜了，我给你４００个瓶盖，怎吗样？}
{108}{}{我真的希望你能保护我们回去。事情这样糟，罗格尔会杀了我的，我也不清楚这点人能不能走回去。如果你有兴趣，我会付你４００个瓶盖，如何？}
{109}{}{我们自己回去的话路上很凶险。你愿意保镖吗？我会给你４００个瓶盖。}
{110}{}{我们居然让两个保镖都送了命，罗格尔和布奇会吃了我的。}
{111}{}{好。}
{112}{}{不干。}
{113}{}{呃。}
{114}{}{太好了，我们走。}
{115}{}{什么，你怕了？}
{116}{}{啊，你会错过路上的很多好玩的事情的。}
{117}{}{算啦。我们应该能平安回去的。谢谢你一路保护我们。}
{118}{}{吧，我能理解。只有一个保镖确实很危险，但我们会平安回去的。}
{119}{}{呃，好吧，我们自己也能回去的。}
{120}{}{你还好吗？这路程是不是对你来说太困难了点？}
{121}{}{你吸毒？}
{122}{}{我想我不需要你这种人。}
{123}{}{改主意了？你想帮我？}
{124}{}{是的。}
{125}{}{不。}
{126}{}{甚？}
{127}{}{很容易挣的钱吧。你想和我们一起回哈勃城吗？报酬还是和过来一样，危险性也是一样的。}
{128}{}{那吗，你还想挣６００个瓶盖吗？我们正想回哈勃，希望回去的路上不会有麻烦。}
{129}{}{我想你会和我们回去的吧。还是６００个瓶盖，有兴趣吗？}
{130}{}{我不想路上死人。所以我们花大钱雇保镖。这条路线很危险。戴米德希望我们早点回去。报酬还是一样，你想跟来吗？}
{131}{}{你还想找刺激吗？这次我们会毫发不伤的。如果你愿意跟我们回哈勃城，我会付６００个瓶盖。}
{132}{}{我知道，死人是不好的事情，但这毕竟是打仗。你想再保一镖吗？我们回哈勃城，报酬还是６００个瓶盖。}
{133}{}{可恶，两个保镖都死了。戴米德会发疯的。我们马上就回程，薪酬一样，你愿意干吗？一起杀歹徒玩？}
{134}{}{真是一路激战啊，两个保镖都死菜了。戴米德不喜欢这样，但至少我们到了。你想送我们回哈勃吗？报酬６００个瓶盖。}
{135}{}{我喜欢干仗，但不喜欢死人。你和我能再走一趟吗？我们马上就走，报酬嘛还是６００个瓶盖，死了不负责抚恤。}
{136}{}{做鬼脸。}
{137}{}{好，我相信这次我们能安全回去的。}
{138}{}{我无论如何真的需要一名保镖。}
{139}{}{啊，我们自己搞定他们。}
{140}{}{啊，你回来了，你想接下这工作？}
{141}{}{啊。}
{142}{}{你好啊，想要工作吗？我们回哈勃需要保镖。单趟４００个瓶盖。}
{143}{}{好。}
{144}{}{不，谢谢。}
{145}{}{好啊。}
{146}{}{你好啊，想要工作吗？我们回哈勃城需要保镖。单趟６００个瓶盖。要有心里准备，这是很危险的活儿。}
{147}{}{好。}
{148}{}{哦。}
{149}{}{想好了和我说，我们下午两点走。}
{150}{}{抱歉，你看起来干不了保镖的活儿。}
{151}{}{你要是连话也说不清，我不能雇你。}
{152}{}{你要是想做事，先戒了毒再说。}
{153}{}{你想好了？}
{154}{}{好，我要你了。}
{155}{}{噶？}
{156}{}{这是你的工资，如果想续约，就和我说。}
