#{100}{}{You see a guard for the Far Go Traders.}
#{101}{}{Those damn Water Merchants are ripp'n us all off.}
#{102}{}{Be sure to pay the FLC on time, they're a deadly lot.}
#{103}{}{You'll want to talk to Rutger.}
#{104}{}{Far Go Traders are the best.}
#{105}{}{The Crimson Caravan are a bunch of idiots and lunatics.}
#{106}{}{Hmm, I've a craving for some iguana on a stick.}
#{107}{}{Who the hell is stealing our caravans?}
#{108}{}{My brother was on the last caravan that disappeared.}
#{109}{}{Those water misers are responsible, I know it.}
#{110}{}{Mutants took the caravans I hear. Terrible thing.}
#{111}{}{Heard you say some Mutants.  Hope you made'em pay.}
#{112}{}{I thought the Death Claw was responsible, damn mutants.}
#{113}{}{We're closed. Come back in the morning.}
#{114}{}{Hey, this isn't the Falcon. Get the hell out.}
#{115}{}{What are you? Some kind of a Skag? Get the hell out.}
#{116}{}{Beat it!}
#{117}{}{We're only open during the day.}
#{118}{}{Are you on drugs? Get lost.}
#{119}{}{You need to come back in the morning.}
{100}{}{你看到一个远行商队的保镖。}
{101}{}{那些该死的水商人把我们全骗了。}
{102}{}{确定准时支付给友好信贷公司了，他们是相当致命的。}
{103}{}{你去和罗格尔谈谈把。}
{104}{}{远行商队是最好的商队。}
{105}{}{深红商队那群白痴不是疯子就是傻子。}
{106}{}{哎，我好想变成一个大蜥蜴啊。}
{107}{}{哪个该死的偷了我们的商队？}
{108}{}{我兄弟在最后一次旅行的时候失踪了。}
{109}{}{我认为，那些守水的吝啬鬼该对这事儿负责。}
{110}{}{我听说是变种人干的。真是可怕的消息。}
{111}{}{听你说是一些变种人。希望你能让他们偿还。}
{112}{}{我认为死亡爪该负主要责任，该死的变种人。}
{113}{}{我们关门了。早上再来把。}
{114}{}{嘿，这不是猎鹰。滚到地狱去吧。}
{115}{}{你算老几？什么垃圾货色？滚蛋……}
{116}{}{走开！}
{117}{}{我们只在白天开放。}
{118}{}{你带了毒品了？滚开！}
{119}{}{你要回来就早上来。}
