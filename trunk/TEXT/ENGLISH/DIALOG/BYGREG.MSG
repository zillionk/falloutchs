{103}{}{嗨，你回来了。别大声说话，他们在外面。}
#{104}{}{Ok, but keep it down, they'll come for both of us if you don't stop shouting.}
{104}{}{好吧，但是小点声，如果你继续叫，他们会过来对付我们两个。}
#{105}{}{Who are you?}
{105}{}{你是谁？}
#{106}{}{Why are you so jumpy?}

#{109}{}{I'm...Greg...but don't let anyone else know, or they'll come find me.}
{109}{}{我是……格雷格……但是不要让别人知道，不然他们会来找我的。}
#{110}{}{Jumpy, I'm not jumpy.  Just careful.  They all say I'm paranoid, but I'm the one that's gonna be here when they come to get us.}
{110}{}{神经质，我不是神经质。我只是谨慎。他们都说我是妄想狂，但我只是他们来抓我们的时候碰巧在那而已。}

#{113}{}{Well they are...You know don't you...The disease was just the start.  Now they're going to come and take as all.  But you are just like all the rest.  You won't believe me, and you'll be doomed.  You mark my words.   I'LL STILL BE HERE, and ALL OF THIS, INCLUDING YOU, WILL BE TAKEN.  TAKEN. 【Greg grasps his head and curls up in a ball, squealing and thrashing about】}
{113}{}{嗯，他们是……你知道吧……疾病只是开始。现在他们要来把我们都抓走。但你和其他人一样。你不相信我，你会遭厄运的。记住我的话吧。我会留在这里，而所有人，包括你，会被抓走。被抓走。【格雷格抓住他的头，全身蜷缩起来，边尖叫边乱挣。】}
#{114}{}{Medication...Oh so you're one of them, trying to get me to take my medication again....Well you won't get me to.  I WON'T TAKE IT, NO, I WON'T.  THE VOICES, NO I WON'T, YOU CAN'T MAKE ME. 【Greg close his eyes shut and clutches his head frantically, talking with the voices that only he can hear.】}
{114}{}{药物治疗……喔，那么你是他们的人，想抓我在去用药……你抓不了我了。我不再吃药了，不，我不。那声音，不我不，你别碰我。【格雷格闭上眼睛，疯狂地抓住他的头，和只有他能听见的声音交谈。】}

{115}{}{你别碰我！}
#{116}{}{NOTHING YOU CAN DO WILL HELP!}
{116}{}{你帮不了我！}

{119}{}{你们都会被抓走！}
