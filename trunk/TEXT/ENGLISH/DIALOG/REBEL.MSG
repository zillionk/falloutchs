# {103}{}{}
# {104}{}{}
# {105}{}{Thank you for saving us.}
# {106}{}{I was a little unsure that you could do it,
# but I trust you now.}
# {107}{}{Thank you! Thank you!}
# {108}{}{You are a hero.  My little Bobby wants to be
# just like you when he grows up. I don't know if I like that.}
# {109}{}{You are a heroine.  My little Bobby wants to be
# just like you when he grows up. I don't know if I like that.}
# {110}{}{You are a swell guy!}
# {111}{}{You are a swell gal!}
# {112}{}{Are you sure you need that in here?}
# {113}{}{That's a weapon!}
# {114}{}{Have you actually used that against someone?}
# {115}{}{Why do you think it is necessary to carry a
# weapon in here?}
# {116}{}{Hello! How goes the search?}
# {117}{}{Pretty well.}
# {118}{}{Not so good.}
# {119}{}{Ugh.}
# {120}{}{Well, that's good to hear. Keep up the good work, I guess.}
# {121}{}{No problem.}
# {122}{}{We knew that there was no hope. I don't think we'll get a
# new chip in time. I think that some of us should move
# outside before it's too late.}
# {123}{}{I don't think that's a good idea.}
# {124}{}{Hmm. That might be best.}
# {125}{}{Please hurry.}
# {126}{}{Don't worry, I'll find the chip.}
# {127}{}{Maybe you should come to one of our meetings. Theresa has some
# good ideas. We meet in her room on the second level, at five
# o'clock each evening.}
# {128}{}{I'll think about it.}
# {129}{}{No thanks. I have work to do.}
# {130}{}{That's what Theresa thinks. She's got it all worked out.
# We're thinking of leaving the Vault soon.}
# {131}{}{Good luck.}
# {132}{}{I don't think you should leave just yet.}
# {133}{}{Why did the Overseer pick you? It's obvious you couldn't find your
# shoelaces, much less a new water chip. Oh well.}
# {134}{}{Urgh.}
# {135}{}{Don't you have a job to do? Hurry and find the chip!}
# {136}{}{Don't tell me what to do, loser boy!}
# {137}{}{Fine! Some people.}
# {138}{}{Gdorf!}
# {139}{}{You've sealed the fate of everyone in this Vault, traitor. I hope you are
# satisfied with yourself.}

{1003}{}{Vault}


# {1100}{}{The Overseer just wants to keep everyone under his control in here. We
# need to go out into the world for ourselves.}
# {1101}{}{The Vault has been our home, but it just won't last any longer. It's time
# to make a new home.}

{100}{}{你看到：避难所居民。}
{101}{}{你看到:沮丧的避难所居民。}
{102}{}{}
{103}{}{}
{104}{}{}
{105}{}{谢谢你救了我们。}
{106}{}{开始我还不太确定你能做到，可我现在信任你了。}
{107}{}{谢谢你！谢谢你！}
{108}{}{你是个英雄！我的小鲍比说长大了要象你一样。我不知道该不该高兴。}
{109}{}{你是个大英雄！我的小鲍比说长大了要象你一样。我不知道该不该高兴。}
{110}{}{你是个壮家伙！}
{111}{}{你是个好女孩！}
{112}{}{你确定你在这里需要那个吗？}
{113}{}{那是件武器！}
{114}{}{你真的用它打过人吗？}
{115}{}{你怎么会认为在这里需要带武器呢？}
{116}{}{你好，搜寻进行的如何？}
{117}{}{很顺利。}
{118}{}{不是很好。}
{119}{}{啊。}
{120}{}{是吗，那太好了。坚持下去。}
{121}{}{没问题。}
{122}{}{我们知道已经没希望了。我不认为咱们能及时拿到新的芯片。我们当中的一部分应该及早迁移到外面去，现在还不晚。}
{123}{}{我不认为那是个好主意。}
{124}{}{恩……那可能是最好的了。}
{125}{}{请尽快吧。}
{126}{}{别担心，我会找到芯片的。}
{127}{}{或许你该来参加一下我们会议。特蕾莎有些不错的提议。每天晚上五点我们会在她二层的房间里碰面。}
{128}{}{我会考虑的。}
{129}{}{不了，谢谢。我还有事要做。}
{130}{}{这就是特蕾莎的想法。她都考虑妥当了。我们开始计划离开避难所了。}
{131}{}{好运了。}
{132}{}{我觉得你们不该现在就离开避难所。}
{133}{}{为什么所长选了你？恐怕你连自己的鞋带都找不到，更别说什么净水芯片了。}
{134}{}{啊。}
{135}{}{你不是有任务要做吗？快去找净水芯片。}
{136}{}{别对我指手画脚，你一无是处。}
{137}{}{好！某些人。}
{138}{}{哦啊！}
{139}{}{你毁了这避难所里所有人的未来，叛徒！现在你满意了吧！}


{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{我可以告诉你：Overseer-所长、Vault13-13号避难所、Vault-13-13号避难所、Vault-避难所。}

{1100}{}{所长只是要这的所有人都处在自己的控制下。为了我们自己，我们要走出去，走到外面的世界。}
{1101}{}{一直以来避难所都是我们的家，但今后不再是了，是时候建立一个新的家园了。}
{1102}{}{一直以来避难所都是我们的家，但今后不再是了，是时候建立一个新的家园了。}
