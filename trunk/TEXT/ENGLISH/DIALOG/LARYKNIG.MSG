{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}




#{100}{}{You see a Knight.}
#{101}{}{Hello Initiate. I'm Larry, how may I help you?}
#{102}{}{Vree said you could show me a laser pistol?}
#{103}{}{Vree said you could give me a laser pistol.}
#{104}{}{Ug.}
#{105}{}{Uh, okay...}
#{106}{}{Uh, yea. These things are great. It's range is... well, as far
# as you can see. (Larry continues to talk for what seems like hours, but
# you seem to pick a few things up about the use of energy weapons.)}
#{107}{}{Huh? But she knows these aren't ready yet... Oh, she must have
# meant show. Yea, I can show you. You see it runs off of energy cells
# that are constructed out of... (Larry goes on for what seems hours but
# you seem to pick a few things up about energy weapons.)}
#{108}{}{Sure she did. I think you should leave outsider.}
#{109}{}{I don't like liars, please leave.}
{100}{}{你看到一名骑士。}
{101}{}{嗨，菜鸟。我叫拉里，需要我帮忙吗？}
{102}{}{弗蕾说你有把激光手枪，能让我看看吗？}
{103}{}{弗蕾说你能帮我弄把激光手枪。}
{104}{}{呃。}
{105}{}{哦，好的……}
{106}{}{噢，是的。这些都是很棒的家伙。它的射程是……喏，能象你视野范围这么远。【拉里喋喋不休的说了近一个小时后，你在能量武器技能上似乎有了些提高。】}
{107}{}{什么？她应该知道这些武器还有问题……噢，她一定是想让我给你演示一下。没问题。你看到流汤的能量电池外部结构……【在拉里不断的演练了近一个小时后，你在能量武器技能上似乎有了些提高。】}
{108}{}{没错。但我认为你这个外来的家伙最好走开。}
{109}{}{我讨厌说谎的人，请你离开。}
#{200}{}{This isn't right at all.}
#{201}{}{There we go.}
#{202}{}{The firing mechanism keeps jamming.}
#{203}{}{That's much better.}
#{204}{}{Almost got it.}
#{205}{}{This is going to take a while.}
#{206}{}{That's the problem!}
#{207}{}{John, I think I isolated the problem.}
#{208}{}{Damn!}
#{209}{}{Darn!}
#{210}{}{My fault!}
#{211}{}{I'm okay.}
#{212}{}{Okay, that hurt.}
#{213}{}{I meant to do that.}
#{214}{}{Why does that keep happening?}
#{215}{}{My eyes!}
#{216}{}{You're not a knight.}
#{217}{}{I need to talk to a knight.}
#{218}{}{I don't understand, the power cells keep shorting out.}
#{219}{}{You should stand back these can be dangerous.}
#{220}{}{Please don't distract me.}
#{221}{}{Watch where you're standing.}
#{222}{}{You lost?}
#{223}{}{Sorry, I can't talk right now.}
#{300}{}{Energy Weapons increases 5%.}
{200}{}{完全不对。}
{201}{}{好了。}
{202}{}{点火装置老是堵塞。}
{203}{}{好多了。}
{204}{}{差点被打中。}
{205}{}{快成了。}
{206}{}{就是这个问题！}
{207}{}{约翰，我想我找到了问题所在！}
{208}{}{该死的！}
{209}{}{可恶啊！}
{210}{}{是我的错！}
{211}{}{我很好。}
{212}{}{好疼啊。}
{213}{}{我就是想这样。}
{214}{}{为什么总是这样？}
{215}{}{噢，我的眼睛！}
{216}{}{你不是一名骑士。}
{217}{}{我需要和一名骑士谈谈。}
{218}{}{我真搞不懂，为什么这块能量电池老是短路。}
{219}{}{这太危险了你最好站远点。}
{220}{}{请别打扰我。}
{221}{}{小心你站的地方。}
{222}{}{你迷路的？}
{223}{}{抱歉，我现在不方便说话。}
{300}{}{能量武器技能提升5%。}
