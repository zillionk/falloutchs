# her parents. I hope you don't mind.}

# it's a good place to rest.}
{113}{}{我需要在这里怀念我的祖先。另外，这里是个休息的好地方。}

# I've heard. You have a good day. We'll go back to her mothers' place.}
{114}{}{天，我一直听说你不会再在乎这个地方了。那就告辞了，我们搬回到她母亲那里去。}

#{116}{}{You should leave. This isn't your place here anymore.}
{116}{}{你应该离开。这里已经不再是你的地方了。}
