#{100}{}{You see Katrina. She has a very pretty smile.}
{100}{}{你看到卡特里娜。笑起来非常可爱。她看着你，似乎有重要的事情要和你说。}

#{101}{}{I am unarmed, please put your weapon away.}
{101}{}{我没有武器，因此请你把武器收起来。}

#{102}{}{Hng!}
{102}{}{呼！}

#{103}{}{Why should I? This looks like a dangerous world.}
{103}{}{为什么我要收起武器？这是个危险的世界。}

#{104}{}{Why's that?}
{104}{}{为什么？}

#{105}{}{Maybe I will, maybe I won't.}
{105}{}{也许我会，也许我不会。}

#{106}{}{I'll assume that means yes.}
{106}{}{我可以保证，那代表“是”。}

#{107}{}{Normally, I would agree with you.  It is very dangerous to travel
# unarmed.  But this is Shady Sands, and we are a peaceful people.  There is
# no need for weapons here.}
{107}{}{通常来说，我认为你说的是对的。不带上武器在外面的世界游荡的确很危险。但这里是沙荫镇，我们都是爱好和平的人民。在这里不需要带武器。}

#{108}{}{Ok.  Thanks.}
{108}{}{好的。谢谢。}

#{109}{}{If you don't put your weapon away, I will not talk with you.  There
# are many people like me.  You should only use force if the situation calls
# for it.}
{109}{}{如果你不放下你的武器，我就不会和你谈话。这里许多人都是这样。你只有在情况危急时才能使用暴力。}

#{110}{}{Hmm, ok.}
{110}{}{嗯，好吧。}

#{111}{}{Welcome to Shady Sands, traveler.  My name is Katrina.  My job is to
# greet strangers and help them understand our village.  We find that
# there are fewer problems if you listen to what I have to say.}
{111}{}{旅行者，欢迎来到沙荫镇。我的名字是卡特里娜。我的工作是接待外来人，让他们理解我们村庄的制度。如果你仔细听我说的话，你一定不会遇到太多麻烦。}

#{112}{}{Wubba!}
{112}{}{呜叭叭！}

#{113}{}{Tell me more about yourself.}
{113}{}{告诉我关于你的事情。}

#{114}{}{Please help me...}
{114}{}{请帮助我……}

#{115}{}{I'm looking for a water-chip.  Seen one?}
{115}{}{我在找一个净水芯片。你看到过吗？}

#{116}{}{I need help finding Tandi.}
{116}{}{我想找坦蒂，我需要帮助。}

#{117}{}{I'm dealing with your radscorpion problem.  Any clues?}
{117}{}{我来解决你们的辐射蝎问题。有什么线索吗？}

#{118}{}{Thanks, maybe later.}
{118}{}{谢谢，也许以后我会听。}

#{119}{}{It is a pity that you are dimwitted.  We will have difficultly
# understanding each other.  I hope the others in your Vault are not like you.}
{119}{}{很遗憾你不想听我的解释。这样我们会很难理解彼此的想法。我希望你的避难所中的其他人不是像你这样。}

#{120}{}{Wubba-val?}
{120}{}{呜叭叭－避难所？}

#{121}{}{Yes, I can tell you are from a Vault.  You have that look about you.
# I came from Vault-15, to the east.  But I had to leave my home and now
# I live here.  Hopefully you will find what you are looking for, even
# if it is just another place to live.  I hope that your Vault did not
# kick you out due to your wits.  I do hope there is another reason.}
{121}{}{是的，我能看出来你是来自于一个避难所。深层次的印记是很难抹去的。我来自东边的15号避难所。但我不得不离开了自己的家园，而我现在生活在这里。希望你能够找到你要找的东西，即使你要找的只是另外一个容身之处。我希望你的避难所不是因为你的智力而把你赶了出来。我真的希望是因为别的什么原因。}

#{122}{}{Hng.}
{122}{}{呼。}

#{123}{}{You will need to find another way to get your answers, as you cannot
# communicate well enough.  I hope that you do not hurt too many people
# in your journey.  Please be nice to the people here, we mean you no harm.}
{123}{}{你必须要找到另外一种方式来得到你的答案，因为你无法足够好地交流。我希望在你的旅途中你没有伤害太多的人。请对这边的居民好一点，我们对你没有恶意。}

#{124}{}{Ahhh.}
{124}{}{啊啊啊。}

#{125}{}{I would be happy to help you.  I myself was once like you.  Hopefully,
# my knowledge will be useful.}
{125}{}{我很高兴能帮助你。我也曾像你这样。很希望我的知识能派上用场。}

#{126}{}{What should I do if I get hurt?}
{126}{}{如果我受伤了，该去哪里治疗？}

#{127}{}{Where can I get some better equipment?}
{127}{}{我在哪里能找到好一点的装备？}

#{128}{}{Tell me about this place.}
{128}{}{给我介绍下这个地方。}

#{129}{}{Tell me about the rest of the world.}
{129}{}{给我介绍下这世界上的其他地方。}

#{130}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{130}{}{给我介绍下你本人。}

#{131}{}{That's all for now, thanks.}
{131}{}{先这样吧，谢谢。}

#{132}{}{Well, if you can't get to a doctor, you will need to heal yourself.  Stimpaks
# are a common healing item.  Use them on yourself to heal minor wounds.
# First Aid is a slower method, but it is always available.  For major
# wounds, like a broken leg, you will need to use Doctor skill.}
{132}{}{如果你没办法找到一个医生，你就得自己治疗自己。针筒是一种最常见的治疗工具。把它使用在自己身上可以治疗轻伤。急救起作用比较慢，但你可以一直使用它而不会损失什么。对于重伤，例如说腿断了，你必须使用医疗技能。}

#{133}{}{You will have to do like we do.  Scavenge it, or trade for it.  And if
# you are attacked, your foes might provide equipment, if you live long
# enough to loot them.  We are a peaceful community, so we mostly barter
# or trade for the items we cannot produce.}
{133}{}{你必须做和我们一样的事情。你需要某种东西，你要么抢夺，要么交易。假如你很能打，你可能会从你的敌人身上得到一些装备，前提是如果你能干掉他们的话。我们这里是一个和平的社区，所以对于那些我们自己无法生产的东西都是靠交易得来的。}

#{134}{}{Tell me more about bartering.}
{134}{}{告诉我关于交易的事。}

#{135}{}{You are standing in Shady Sands.  We are but a small town in a large
# world.  We just want to be left alone.  Besides some mutated animals
# and other creatures of the desert, only the Raiders give us trouble.
# Aradesh is our leader.  He is in the large central house, speak to him.}
{135}{}{你脚下的土地是沙荫镇。我们仅仅是这广大世界中的一个小镇。我们不想引起别人的注意，除了一些变种的动物和其他沙漠上的生物以外，只有歹徒给我们带来麻烦。亚拉德什是我们的镇长。他在城镇中间的大房子里，你可以和他谈。}

#{136}{}{I know very little of the outside world.  I escaped from a Vault when
# it was attacked.  Unfortunately, I was very hurt and do not remember
# much of what happened.  But Dharma was watching over me, and I was
# found by the people of Shady Sands.  I live here now.  Have you
# spoken with Ian, yet?  He is a merchant guard who was hurt.  He is
# recovering in the guardhouse over there. 【She points to the east】
# He is more widely travelled than I.}
{136}{}{我对于外面的世界知道得相当少。我是在我的避难所被攻击时逃出来的。很不幸，我那时受了伤，所以不太记得究竟发生了什么。不过我活了下来，我被沙荫镇的人们救了。我现在住在这里。你和伊恩谈过吗？他是一个受了伤的商队守卫。他现在那边的警卫室疗伤。【她指向东边】他是个见多识广的人。}

#{137}{}{My life was very boring.  I was raised in a Vault.  I lived there for
# many years.  Unfortunately, we were crowded and life was very bad.
# There was a schism, and many people left, taking with them the best
# equipment.  Still, some of us tried to stay in the Vault.  But then we
# were attacked.  I was hurt, and I ended up here.  Now I try
# to help people . . .}
{137}{}{我的生活相当乏味。我成长在一座避难所中，并且在那里生活了许多年。不幸的是，我们的人口发生了爆炸，生存条件越来越差。于是人们发生了分裂，一部分人带走了最好的设备。我和部分人仍然试图留在避难所，但随后我们遭到了攻击。我受伤了，后来被这里的人所救。现在我也尝试着帮助别人……}

#{138}{}{Where was this Vault of yours?}
{138}{}{你的这一个避难所在哪里呢？}

#{139}{}{Bartering is the exchange of goods. You give me some items,
# and I give you items in trade. Since you initiated the barter,
# I will let you pick and choose what you want. But the deal must be one that
# I think I will like, so you will probably want to give me more valuable
# goods that you don't need in exchange for less expensive things that you want.
# And if you don't have enough items to trade, there are always caps.
# Bottle caps are the only common money found out here. The caps are backed
# by the merchants of the Hub, so you can trade them anywhere.}
{139}{}{交易就是交换物品。你给我一些物品，我也给你一些物品作为交换。当你开始交易的时候，我会让你选择你要的东西。但交易必须是在我得到我想要的东西的时候才能成功，因此你也得把你手中更有价值但你并不需要的东西给我，以换取价值相对较低的东西。如果你的物品不够，我们还有瓶盖。瓶盖是这里的唯一通用货币。哈勃商人一直在大力推广瓶盖货币，所以你可以在任何地方用它进行交易。}

#{140}{}{It was Vault-15.  It is due east of here.  We tried to make contact
# with some other Vaults, but we always failed.  I think it was the
# raiders who attacked my fellow dwellers.  Be careful!}
{140}{}{那是15号避难所。它就在正东方。我们尝试联络其他的避难所，但总是失败。我认为是歹徒攻击了居住在那里的同胞。所以你要小心点！}

#{141}{}{I hope you find her.  She is like a little sister to me.  I think it
# was one of the raider groups who took her.  Find out as much information
# about them as you can and equip yourself before you go after them. But don't
# be so quick to fight, even they will sometimes listen to reason...}
{141}{}{我希望你能找到她。她就像我的妹妹一样。我认为是一伙歹徒把她抓走了。你最好先打探消息，同时准备好你的装备以便追踪他们，但不要急于战斗，即使是他们，有时候也会讲点道理……}

#{142}{}{Seth has been trying to follow the radscorpions.  He claims that he
# even knows the way to their lair, but I think he is a little scared
# of going out there.  His brother was seriously injured by one of
# the mutants, and Seth doesn't quite know what to do.}
{142}{}{赛思一直在试图跟踪辐射蝎。他甚至宣称他知道去蝎子窝的路，但我认为他有些害怕它们，不敢离开这里。他的兄弟被一只辐射蝎咬伤了，赛思对此就无能为力。}

#{143}{}{As a matter of fact, yes.  My old home, Vault-15, had one.  I
# haven't been there since I was hurt, but you might find what you
# are looking for there.  Someone said that they tried to go to the
# Vault to have a look around, but it was dark and the elevator was
# broken.  I hope you're better prepared.}
{143}{}{事实上，是的。15号避难所是我以前的家。自从我受伤后再也没有回去过那里，但你很可能会在那里找到你需要的东西。有些人说他们试图进入避难所看看，但那里很黑，而且电梯坏了。我希望你能准备周全些。}

#{144}{}{Hello again.  I hope you are doing well.  Is there anything I can help you with?}
{144}{}{很高兴再次见到你。我希望你的任务进行得顺利。我能帮你什么吗？}

#{145}{}{Don't you ever go to sleep?}
{145}{}{你从来都不睡觉吗？}

#{146}{}{Well, I take catnaps when you are not around.  Besides, I find the desert
# air very invigorating and healthy.  And I never tire of looking at the
# stars.  Can you imagine never seeing the night sky for your entire life?
# 【She pauses and looks at you】 Oh, I guess you can.}
{146}{}{你不在这边的时候我会小睡一会。还有，沙漠的空气令人精神爽快，而且很健康。所以我可以整晚看星星都不累。你能想象一生都看不到夜晚天空的人吗？【她停下来看着你】哦，我想你能。}

#{147}{}{Ah, yeah.  Thanks.}
{147}{}{啊，是的。谢谢。}

#{148}{}{Is there a doctor around here?}
{148}{}{这附近有医生吗？}

#{149}{}{Small places like Shady Sands would not be able to survive without the
# help of a healer.  Our doctor, Razlo, lives in southern most house.  If you
# are seriously hurt, see him.  Try not to bother him at night.  He's a pretty
# cranky person without his sleep.}
{149}{}{像沙荫镇这样的小地方，没有医生是无法生存的。我们的医生拉斯洛住在最南边的房子里。如果你受了重伤，就去找他吧，不过最好不要在晚上打扰他，他如果睡不好觉，脾气是很暴躁的。}

#{150}{}{You gain 250 experience points for the knowledge you have gained from
# Katrina.}
{150}{}{你通过卡特里娜得到了知识，因此你获得250点经验值。}

#{151}{}{They usually hang thieves around here.  Be good.}
{151}{}{经常有小偷在这里被绞死。注意你的行为。}
