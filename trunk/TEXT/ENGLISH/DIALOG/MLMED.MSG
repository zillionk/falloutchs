# {100}{}{You see two super mutants. One looks hurt, and the other is tending him.}
# {101}{}{Well, how do you feel now?}
# {102}{}{【moves his shoulder】 Ah, it's still a little sore. At least the bleeding stopped.}
# {103}{}{Good, good. Keep using your medication and you should be good as new.}
# {104}{}{Excellent. When I get my hands on that little human, I'm going to crush him.}
# {105}{}{Excellent. When I get my hands on that little human, I'm going to crush her.}
# {106}{}{He sure did enough damage that last time. I hope they get him soon.}
# {107}{}{She did enough damage that last time. I hope they get her soon.}
# {108}{}{Imagine if all of our plans were ruined because of one little human.}
# {109}{}{【laughs】 Yeah, that would be a shame.}

{100}{}{你看到两个超级变种人，其中一个受伤了，另一个搀扶着他。}
{101}{}{哦，你现在感觉怎么样？}
{102}{}{【动动肩膀】嗯，还有点疼，不过至少止血了。}
{103}{}{好，好，如果你继续给我们治理的话，你会是一个大大的好人。}
{104}{}{很好，如果让我抓到那个小人我会捏碎他。}
{105}{}{很好，如果让我抓到那个小人我会捏碎她。}
{106}{}{他在最后一次造成很大的损失，我希望他们很快就能抓到他。}
{107}{}{她在最后一次造成很大的损失，我希望他们很快就能抓到她。}
{108}{}{想象一下，如果我们的全盘计划都毁灭了，而只是因为一个小人。}
{109}{}{【大笑】是啊，那真是丢人啊。}
{110}{}{【偷着笑】}
