{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{Sorry, no boxing today.}
#{101}{}{Hnn.}
#{102}{}{Uk, okay.}
#{103}{}{When's the next match?}
#{104}{}{You might try signing up with Gizmo. I hear he's always looking for new meat to toss in the ring.}
#{105}{}{Try again tomorrow. Saul will be boxing then.}
#{106}{}{You just missed it. Try again in a couple of days. Saul boxes every three days.}
#{107}{}{Thanks.}
#{108}{}{Who's Saul?}
#{109}{}{Saul is the local champion. Saul is the current favorite of Gizmo.}
#{110}{}{Hey, there. No boxing today.}
#{111}{}{ Try again tomorrow.}
#{112}{}{ Try again the day after tomorrow.}
#{113}{}{So! Want to lay a bet on the fight?}
#{114}{}{I've got better things to do with my money. Goodbye.}
#{115}{}{What are the odds?}
#{116}{}{No, thanks. Mind if I ask a few questions, though?}
#{117}{}{}
#{118}{}{Sorry, but today's match is already over.}
#{119}{}{Oh. Well, never mind, then.}
#{120}{}{Who do you want to bet on, Saul or the challenger? Odds favor Saul winning. Cost is 25 caps to bet; you get 50 if you win betting on Saul, 100 if you win betting on the challenger!}
#{121}{}{I'll bet on Saul.}
#{122}{}{I'll bet on the challenger.}
#{123}{}{All right, I guess.}
#{124}{}{Who's the boxer?}
#{125}{}{Who runs these matches?}
#{126}{}{Uh, never mind.}
#{127}{}{Sorry, I don't have the time. Maybe later.}
#{128}{}{Saul, the fastest fist in Junktown! He's a marvel of manly musculature! A pulsating power puncher!}
#{129}{}{He's a nice guy, too.}
#{130}{}{Um, yeah. So, who runs these matches?}
#{131}{}{Thanks. See you around.}
#{132}{}{Gizmo, the casino owner, employs Saul. He occasionally likes to watch a match or two, but mostly it's good money - people will bet a lot on a fight. And nobody has to get killed, unlike those death matches they supposedly have in the Hub.}
#{133}{}{Death matches?}
#{134}{}{Thanks.}
#{135}{}{Well, it's just a rumor. But they say there's an underground fighting ring there where you can pay to watch people fight to the death. Not my kind of fight.}
#{136}{}{Hmm. Thanks.}
#{137}{}{Hey, what are you doing?}
#{138}{}{Uh, nothing.}
#{139}{}{You wanna start something, loser?}
#{140}{}{Please quit it.}
#{141}{}{Uh, no. Never mind. Forget I said anything.}
#{142}{}{Well, well, looks like you're a winner! Here's your caps.}
#{143}{}{Come back when you have enough caps to bet!}
#{144}{}{Would you like to wait here until the fight starts at 2:00?}
#{145}{}{Sure, what the heck.}
#{146}{}{Nah, I got stuff to do. I'll be back later.}
#{147}{}{Okay, but if you miss, the fight, you forfeit your bet!}
#{148}{}{Let the fight begin!}
#{149}{}{Please don't disturb me while the match is in progress.}

{100}{}{抱歉，今天没有拳击赛。}
{101}{}{恩【有些犹豫】。}
{102}{}{恩，好的。}
{103}{}{下场比赛什么时候？}
{104}{}{你应该试着向吉斯莫找工作。我听说他正在找新人进拳击场。}
{105}{}{明天再来试吧。你会在拳击场上见到索尔。}
{106}{}{你刚错过了，两三天后再来，索尔每三天有一场比赛。}
{107}{}{多谢。}
{108}{}{索尔是谁？}
{109}{}{索尔是地区拳击冠军，也是吉斯莫最得力的拳击手。}
{110}{}{嘿，那里，今天没有拳击比赛。}
{111}{}{明天再来吧。}
{112}{}{后天再来试试。}
{113}{}{那么！你想在比赛中下赌注吗？}
{114}{}{我的钱要用在更重要的事情上，再见。}
{115}{}{有多大获胜的把握？}
{116}{}{不，多谢。介意我问些问题吗？}
{117}{}{}
{118}{}{抱歉，今天的比赛结束了。}
{119}{}{恩，好的。不要介意。}
{120}{}{你想赌谁？索尔还是挑战者？押索尔要25个瓶盖，但能赢50个。压挑战者能赢100个瓶盖！}
{121}{}{我押索尔。}
{122}{}{我会压给挑战者。}
{123}{}{我猜都很好。}
{124}{}{拳击手是谁？}
{125}{}{这些比赛是谁组织的？}
{126}{}{啊，别介意。}
{127}{}{抱歉，我没有太多的时间，等会吧。}
{128}{}{索尔，迦克镇出拳最快的拳击手！他的肌肉非常的夸张！他一拳就可以把人的身体打穿！}
{129}{}{他是一个漂亮的家伙。}
{130}{}{恩，好，谁组织的这些比赛。}
{131}{}{谢谢。一会见。}
{132}{}{吉斯莫，是雇佣索尔的赌场老板。他偶尔来看一两场比赛，但绝大多数时间是来赚钱－很多人会赌这种拳击比赛。这里没有人会被杀死，不像哈勃城那些杀人比赛。}
{133}{}{杀人比赛？}
{134}{}{谢谢。}
{135}{}{它只是一个传言。但是他们说有一个地下拳击场，你可以付钱看到死亡比赛。不是现在的这种。}
{136}{}{恩，谢谢。}
{137}{}{嘿，你在干什么？}
{138}{}{没什么。}
{139}{}{你是想干些什么吧，失败者？}
{140}{}{请退出。}
{141}{}{哦不，别在意，忘了我所说的。}
{142}{}{哈哈，好像你是一个获胜者！给你的瓶盖。}
{143}{}{等你有了足够的瓶盖再回来吧！}
{144}{}{你想在这里等2:00的比赛吗？}
{145}{}{当然。}
{146}{}{不了，我知道怎么做了。我一会回来。}
{147}{}{那你要是错过了比赛，你的赌注就没了！}
{148}{}{比赛开始！}
{149}{}{正在比赛不要打扰我。}
{150}{}{你没能全赢他们，朋友，下次好运。}
{151}{}{你没能全赢他们，宝贝儿，下次好运。}
{152}{}{抱歉，一次比赛只能赌一次。}
